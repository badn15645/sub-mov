00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:10,403
Look at the stars,
whenever you feel alone,

3
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:15,950
the great kings of the past
will always be prepared to guide you.

4
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,161
And so will I.

5
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:40,869
My friends, the time of
my family's growth is upon us.

6
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:45,456
This home we share is the
fulfillment of my father's vision.

7
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,710
How wonderful is it
that Nala and I get to continue

8
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,213
his dream and make
even greater the circle of life.

9
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,931
Nala my love, I'm on my way.

10
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:42,972
Nala, I'm here.

11
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:45,934
I'm here.

12
00:03:49,479 --> 00:04:01,908
Security detail has arrived.

13
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,744
One gentle reminder, we are not food.

14
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,536
No, no, no, no, no.

15
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:09,207
We are just two guys walking to
work through a pride of hungry lion.

16
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:11,918
Which is perfectly
normal, I'm not terrified.

17
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:17,048
Security detail reporting
for due to your grace, your highness.

18
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,175
Ruler of all four legged creatures.

19
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,803
And that one three legged zebra.

20
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:22,679
Oh right, Ron.

21
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:23,763
That was tragic.

22
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:24,889
It was an Eden Ron.

23
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:25,306
Yeah.

24
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,684
Ron has three legs,
that's the one more than me.

25
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,935
Well, are those arms or legs?

26
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,311
I don't know, I think they're paws.

27
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:31,980
I consider all those legs.

28
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,231
Guys, this is serious.

29
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,233
I need you to stay
with Kiara until I get back.

30
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:41,739
Are you saying that your security
detail has been called on to do babysitting?

31
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:44,993
Pumba, we should really discuss
this because I don't really love children.

32
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,120
Guys, I promise her
everything would be okay.

33
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,663
Well, that's one way to parent.

34
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,580
You're gonna have to grow up sometime.

35
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:50,873
What else did you tell her?

36
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,625
That she could be
whatever she wants to be?

37
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,334
That life is fair?

38
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,837
I need you two to try
and act like adults, okay?

39
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,047
Don't scare Kiara.

40
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,507
And most of all, no stories.

41
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,216
No stories?

42
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,009
Wait a second.

43
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:01,926
I know where your head goes.

44
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,678
I grew up with you two. Promise me.

45
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:04,220
Okay, you know what?

46
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:04,679
You know what?

47
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:05,263
Fine.

48
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,723
No stories.

49
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,266
Speak for yourself, Pumba.

50
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:08,474
No.

51
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:08,975
Shh.

52
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,268
We'll tell a story anyway.

53
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,145
Okay, well, Tom,
we're not gonna tell a story.

54
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:12,937
We're never gonna tell a story.

55
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:13,438
Are you serious?

56
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,565
I'm clearly within earshot.

57
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:15,773
Dad.

58
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,695
Hey, little one.

59
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,158
Dad, the storm's coming and I'm scared.

60
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,784
I want to go with you and Mom.

61
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,536
Well, don't be scared, my love.

62
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,580
Timon and Pumba will
watch you while I'm gone.

63
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,373
Be brave now, Kiara.

64
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,083
Be brave.

65
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:40,131
Okay!

66
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,758
We've prepared a story!

67
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,012
Sky looked at us.

68
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,930
He knew it was the end of the line.

69
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,974
I could smell the fear.

70
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:52,226
That was actually me, but yes.

71
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:13,289
So you two defeated
Scar and then you ate him?

72
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,458
Honestly, one of
the best meals I ever had.

73
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,502
My dad told me he defeated Scar.

74
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:21,005
Well, okay, but your dad, as
we all know, is a pathological liar.

75
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,215
He's always lying.

76
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:22,840
Get it?

77
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,053
I'm scared.

78
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,513
I want Mom and Dad.

79
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,265
Look, look, look,
look, don't be scared, Kiara.

80
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,225
How about...

81
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,268
He sent you a song.

82
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:38,022
And a what? Pumba, no, it
is way too early for the song.

83
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,065
It worked on Simba.

84
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,900
He thought he had
murdered his own father.

85
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,610
He was singing and
dancing around in seconds.

86
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,613
I can't just turn it on like
that. I have to be in the moment.

87
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,448
He sang that song for six years straight.

88
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,157
Well, who didn't?

89
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,121
It's Ron, the
three-legged zebra. Run for your life!

90
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,664
He didn't even say anything about it.

91
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,082
We're sorry, Ron. They were jokes.

92
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:57,208
They were just jokes.

93
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,709
It's Rafiki.

94
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,920
Rafiki! Rafiki!

95
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,716
Little one, there's no reason to cry.

96
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,469
My parents, they're gone.

97
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,514
Hey, look out there, Mdugle.

98
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,350
You see those
bough-bough trees blowing in the wind?

99
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:18,855
The roots of those trees
are very strong, like your family.

100
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,274
And just as they did for you,

101
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,861
your parents have gone to
the ceremony of birth in grounds.

102
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:30,199
And when they return, the circle of
life will bring a blessing to you, Kiara,

103
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:33,286
that you will never forget.

104
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:34,620
Man, he's good.

105
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,789
He's such a visual story to him.

106
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,666
Yet it makes sense that he lives alone.

107
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:43,754
I just want the storm to
pass, and then I promise to be brave.

108
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,632
I tell you a secret.

109
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,260
When your father Simba was your age,

110
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:53,431
he was afraid of the
thunder and would hide behind the king.

111
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,765
When did he stop hiding?

112
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:59,228
One day during a big stop, your
grandfather Mufasa took your father to the lake.

113
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,190
He was the very top of Bright Rock,

114
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:06,027
taught him to stand
with him and howl into the wind.

115
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,779
And Simba slowly
stepped out with the king,

116
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:12,366
and together they roared into the night.

117
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:16,162
But I'm not brave like my dad.

118
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,748
I could never be like Mufasa.

119
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:20,750
He's not so.

120
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:25,421
And maybe it's time I tell you a story.

121
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,216
A story of a cub,
not much bigger than you.

122
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:32,220
A lion born without a
drop of nobility in his blood.

123
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:36,140
A lion who would
change over lives forever.

124
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:37,225
A story!

125
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,060
So glad I brought some presents.

126
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,603
But go easy, we're in a cave.

127
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:45,107
This story begins far
beyond the mountains and the shadows,

128
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,443
on the other side of the light.

129
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,739
In this place,
everything was dying of this.

130
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:56,202
As twenty-full moons have
passed without a single drop of water.

131
00:08:56,244 --> 00:09:02,250
But when the skies
finally opened, destiny would rain.

132
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:32,238
Mufasa.

133
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,284
Mufasa! Come see!

134
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,875
Mom, what is that light way out there?

135
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,420
Oh, that's very special.

136
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,216
Beyond the horizon,
beyond the last cloud in the sky,

137
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,594
that's a place we call "Milele".

138
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:56,762
Milele?

139
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,265
Well, it means "forever".

140
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:05,229
Imagine a kingdom
full of life, water and food,

141
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:09,400
grass and sky as far as the eye can see.

142
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,568
Will we ever go there?

143
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:14,280
Oh, yes, Mufasa.
That's exactly where we're headed.

144
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,199
But we can also be there right now.

145
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:22,455
We can close our
eyes, let our dreams take us.

146
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:35,843
Beyond the horizon,
beyond the last cloud in the sky,

147
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,138
there's a place I know.

148
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:51,901
Imagine a kingdom, the water
flows, the grass and sky as not a dream.

149
00:10:53,235 --> 00:11:02,119
They will grow, call it Milele.

150
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:29,522
We know that there is
nothing wrong, there is always more.

151
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,983
Can you feel it?

152
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:39,281
We'll wander, no
longer, we carry answers.

153
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,452
We'll find a way, can you see it?

154
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,496
And can you see it?

155
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,123
Can you find a way?

156
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:57,258
We'll wander, no
longer, we carry answers.

157
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:23,075
We will bring Milele.

158
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:37,631
What is this?

159
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:42,303
Rain, rain! Finally we have rain!

160
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,349
Dad, race it to the light!

161
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:53,856
You're too fast, I've never
beaten you, nobody has ever beaten you.

162
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,483
I know!

163
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,862
Mufasa, fastest cup in the world!

164
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,254
Mufasa, come back now!

165
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,618
Mufasa, stay there! I'm coming, son!

166
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,008
Father! Mufasa!

167
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:13,602
Mufasa! I'll catch you on the turn!

168
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,312
Find my voice!

169
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,273
Find my voice!

170
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:18,566
Mufasa!

171
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,319
The clippers do have
but you can cross it to them!

172
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:27,449
Come on, Mufasa, you can do this.

173
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:28,659
Find my voice!

174
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:28,867
Mufasa! Mufasa!

175
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:29,034
Mufasa!

176
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:29,451
Mufasa!

177
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:30,202
Mufasa!

178
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,245
You can cross it to them!

179
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,539
Come on, Mufasa, you can do this.

180
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,207
Find your mother's voice!

181
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,711
Listen to your
father, Mufasa, listen to us!

182
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,798
Come here, he's there!

183
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,133
Mom!

184
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,092
He's there!

185
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:46,885
Mother! Mother!

186
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,182
Find your footing one step at a time!

187
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:52,850
I can't!

188
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,643
You can do this, I'm right here!

189
00:15:03,235 --> 00:16:03,295
Mufasa! Mom?

190
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:05,839
Dad?

191
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,634
Can you hear me?

192
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,637
Is anyone out there?

193
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:15,474
Mom!

194
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,560
Please.

195
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,313
Mom, he's there.

196
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,108
Mom, he's there.

197
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:31,532
The floodwaters joined the distant river,

198
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:35,411
carried Mufasa far
from his mother and father,

199
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,746
beyond all that he knew.

200
00:16:52,261 --> 00:17:05,733
Mufasa!

201
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:06,316
Hello!

202
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,194
I'm Taka, son of a barsee.

203
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,112
What's your name?

204
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:10,738
Mufasa.

205
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,365
I'm not allowed to talk to outsiders,

206
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:17,703
but I have a secret,
and I really want to tell you.

207
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,370
What's the secret?

208
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:19,455
I'll get in trouble.

209
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:20,205
Please, just tell me.

210
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,750
I don't know.

211
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,834
Just tell me!

212
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:24,168
OK.

213
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:25,961
You're about to be eaten!

214
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,923
I hate secrets!

215
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:32,593
Swim!

216
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,512
You have to swim! I don't know how!

217
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,598
All right, chin up, then walk underwater.

218
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:38,557
Really fast!

219
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:39,892
I can't!

220
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:40,893
Come on, you faster!

221
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:42,227
Faster!

222
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,439
Help me, Taka!

223
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,231
Help me!

224
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:53,947
[growling]

225
00:17:53,947 --> 00:18:01,705
I told you to wait for me.

226
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:02,873
It's not my fault, Mum.

227
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,375
I came down for a
drink and saw him floating by.

228
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,960
I'd like you to meet Mufasa.

229
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,589
You're lucky those crocs
were young and afraid to fight.

230
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:11,340
Let's go.

231
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,300
We can't just leave him here.

232
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,718
Rules are rules, Taka.

233
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,137
Obasi will never accept a stray.

234
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:18,222
I'm not a stray.

235
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,099
I'm just lost.

236
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:21,934
See?

237
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,311
He's just lost.

238
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,231
There was a flood.

239
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,359
My parents, they tried to save me.

240
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,696
Do you know which way is home?

241
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:36,990
Home.

242
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,619
To be lost is to learn the way.

243
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:42,454
Call me Eshe.

244
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,914
I'm tired, Eshe.

245
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,250
Come on, it's this way.

246
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,560
Come on, Rufasa.

247
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:17,948
Is this Malaylin? No, my love.

248
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,998
I was trying to nap, Eshe.

249
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,417
The all-important nap of kings,

250
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:33,964
only to be awoken by the
disgusting, hideous, revolting stench of a stray.

251
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,841
Will we come upon an outsider?

252
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,968
Tell me, what do we do?

253
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,178
Obasi, I know.

254
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:40,971
Eat it.

255
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,973
But I found him, Dad.

256
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,182
I saved his life.

257
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,519
Baka, we do not associate with outsiders.

258
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,397
The only true bond is blood.

259
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:54,109
I've heard stories
of lions twice our size.

260
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:58,155
These outsiders will
devour everything in their path.

261
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,991
Does he look like
he's going to devour you?

262
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,620
Oh, that smell is disgusting.

263
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,039
I'm not even sure
I could eat this kepete.

264
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:07,956
I'm not a kepete.

265
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,249
I'm a Mufasa.

266
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,335
Do you even know what Mufasa means?

267
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:12,044
No.

268
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,211
It means king.

269
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,379
And that's me.

270
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:18,175
You better start
running, little Mufasa, for your life.

271
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,302
If I run, you'll never catch me.

272
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,012
I'm the fastest kapa I ever lived.

273
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,180
My father taught me so.

274
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,682
Oh, Taka, you have a challenge.

275
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,685
They will race to the dead tree and back.

276
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:33,690
And when the prince defeats
him, I will finish him in one battle.

277
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,233
What if Mufasa wins?

278
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,737
If he wins, he lives, Obasi.

279
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,280
He stays with me.

280
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,240
You have my word.

281
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:46,453
Let the race begin.

282
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,498
Ooh, clumsy little stray.

283
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:50,958
Run, Mufasa.

284
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:52,960
You did not have to do that.

285
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,670
Taka is the future king.

286
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,339
He has to win his first challenge.

287
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,048
No, Obasi.

288
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,342
To be a true king, he must earn it.

289
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,219
Don't take that away from him.

I have one more secret, Professor.

297
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,139
I always wanted a brother.

Zeta! Obasi!

302
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,578
You will keep him with the females.

303
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:56,708
Tucker, how could you lose to a stray?

304
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,754
Well done, Tucker. Well done.

305
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:05,592
I thought you said you
were fast. I had to let you in.

306
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,677
Well, I did just go
gaze with no sleep, all right?

307
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,180
Anyway, come on, me
fusser. Let's get some trouble.

I always wanted a brother.

316

I still remember my
mother one season after another.

317
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:00,475
One season after another.

318
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:07,148
Season after season
after season after another.

319
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,527
Who would sing for my brother?

320
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,362
Who would do anything for my brother?

321
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,949
I'll be king with my brother on my side.

322
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,285
I always wanted a brother.

323

Now we rely on each other.

324

Season after another.

325
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,291
He moved faster.

326
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:27,210
His and Tucker are
anxious to the other side.

327
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:31,131
They're anxious to the other side.

00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:48,732
(growling)

333
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:52,861
(laughing)

334
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:55,280
Togaro jumped like 20 feet!

335
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:56,614
Oh, that's a new record!

336
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,783
Obasi, they did it again!

337
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,077
Your sons are nothing but trouble.

338
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,413
That one is not my son.

339
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,457
They're heathens, the both of them.

340
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:08,918
This stray is
forbidden to be near the shade tree.

341
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,295
Mufos and I were just playing.

342
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,756
You two will never be brothers.

343
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:17,302
Go back to the
females and stay away from my son.

344
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,556
Oh, your mother, she adopts every lizard.

345
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,059
Speaks to passing grasshoppers.

346
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,352
I want to go with him.

347
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:26,770
You want to be with the females.

348
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,813
You belong with the males.

349
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,648
He gets to hunt with mother.

350
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,735
One day, he will betray you.

351
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,363
That is what strays do.

352
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:38,114
Mufos and we'll never betray me.

353
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:42,786
Hey, hey, this will all be yours, my son.

354
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,579
You will be king.

355
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,164
So pay attention.

356
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,210
Study every move I make.

357
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,962
Sleeping again.

358
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:54,798
That is what males do.

359
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,467
We protect the pride as we nap.

360
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,470
That's, well, that's power.

361
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:05,642
Power.

362
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,034
Why are we stopping?

363
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:27,122
Close your eyes
and tell me what you hear.

364
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,250
What you feel.

365
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,966
There's a herd of antelope

366
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,343
heading across the dry lake bed.

367
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,138
Half a day from here.

368
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,890
And how do you know they're not gazelles?

369
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:50,395
Their steps are too
heavy, moving way too slow.

370
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,312
What else?

371
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,524
Come on, you can do it.

372
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,777
When the wind hits their horns,

373
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,448
it moves up instead of across.

374
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,492
So definitely animal horns.

375
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:05,827
Very good.

376
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,209
What is it, Mufasa?

377
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:14,627
What's wrong?

378
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,254
Sometimes I get a sin.

379
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:18,548
It's barely a trace on the wind.

380
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:20,884
It smells like home.

381
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,598
And it's gone.

382
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,059
Mufasa, your parents are still out there.

383
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:31,436
We can keep looking.

384
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,854
I've lost them, Eshe.

385
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,148
You're wasting your
time training me like this.

386
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,443
But these skills you
have, no other male has them.

387
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,278
Obasi will never accept me.

388
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:43,156
I'll never be his blood, his family.

389
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,324
But you are my family.

390
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:48,077
And if Obasi could
see how gifted you are.

391
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,121
Well, maybe I like being a stray.

392
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:53,625
You know, no rules, no responsibility.

393
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,585
I'm the lucky one, Eshe.

394
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:56,628
What do you mean, Mufasa?

395
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,963
I never have to be like Taka.

396
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,633
I never have to be King.

397
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:07,764
Ay-ay-ay.

398
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:09,974
Ay-ay-ay.

399
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,524
Did he say no
rules and no responsibility?

400
00:30:17,815 --> 00:30:20,318
An outcast afraid of
water never takes a bath.

401
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,528
Which means he smells like me?

402
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,487
Which is not good.

403
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:25,865
Well, either way, I think
that means that he's one of us.

404
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:27,534
This is it?

405
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:28,284
It's our time.

406
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,829
And a one, and a two, and a one, two.

407
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:32,956
Hakuna Mufasa

408
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,917
What a wonderful name

409
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,835
Hakuna Mufasa

410
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,755
He ain't no passing craze

411
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,590
It means no wrong.

412
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:43,258
What?

413
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,884
Don't you go, man.

414
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:45,760
All right, all right.

415
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,512
Rafiki's right,
we'll get letters from legal.

416
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,430
Faltres will take everything we have.

417
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:51,474
Which technically is nothing.

418
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,892
Look at us, we're naked animals.

419
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,102
It's the wonder I'm always freezing.

420
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,186
They want this.

421
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,145
Come on, Pumbaa.

422
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,772
Let's bring it home.

423
00:30:57,855 --> 00:30:58,940
Hakuna Mufasa

424
00:30:59,440 --> 00:30:59,649
Quiet!

425
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:02,527
Here is a music snob.

426
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,195
Rafiki, keep going.

427
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:10,159
Later that day, Eshe was teaching Mufasa

428
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,869
how to hunt in pairs.

429
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:15,832
But as Taka was secretly watching,

430
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:19,127
something terrible was hunting them.

431
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,338
(suspenseful music)

432
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:30,763
(suspenseful music)

433
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:01,669
(suspenseful music)

434
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:01,878
Quiet.

435
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:04,172
Quiet.

436
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:10,637
(suspenseful music)

437
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:16,893
Mufasa, run!

438
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:19,646
Ashwin!

439
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,232
(grunting)

440
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:26,277
Ashwin!

441
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:32,408
(suspenseful music)

442
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,128
Keep moving, Mufasa.

443
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,506
Hey, go for the net!

444
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:49,801
(suspenseful music)

445
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:01,354
(growling)

446
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:06,693
It's okay, Mufasa.

447
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:08,695
It's okay.

448
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:11,364
It's okay.

449
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,158
I was very brave of you, Mufasa.

450
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:15,910
Thank you.

451
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,212
Eshe, what has happened?

452
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,507
Are you hurt?

453
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,720
They were huge, white as ghosts,

454
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,431
like nothing I've seen before.

455
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:39,225
Oh, Vasi.

456
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,396
Had Mufasa not been there, I...

457
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,942
(growling)

458
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:49,235
Taka.

459
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:54,407
(suspenseful music)

460
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,120
(growling)

461
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,915
I owe you a great debt, Mufasa.

462
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:05,960
We need to prepare.

463
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,880
They're downwind, less than a day away.

464
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,843
No, you couldn't possibly know this.

465
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,470
Send a scout and you'll see.

466
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,264
They'll be coming for us.

467
00:34:20,057 --> 00:34:20,349
J'Aril.

468
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,646
Father, please, let me explain.

469
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:26,147
Not now.

470
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:27,940
Not now?

471
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:30,526
Taka, come.

472
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:41,245
(growling)

473
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,299
Where is my son?

474
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,468
There was a young lion, Majesty.

475
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,011
He fought Sha'ju.

476
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:01,390
And yet, you came back.

477
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,477
You survived.

478
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:05,645
I was badly hurt.

479
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:07,814
I promise, Majesty, this is the truth.

480
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:08,648
The truth.

481
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:09,899
Yes, the truth.

482
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:13,736
The truth is standing behind you.

483
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:15,988
(growling)

484
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:19,200
There were others.

485
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:19,909
He's Majesty.

486
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,703
But only one left blood on his name.

487
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:25,581
Which means he left Sha'ju to die.

488
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:26,833
Saved himself.

489
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,836
This young lion will see him their king.

490
00:35:30,127 --> 00:35:31,963
His blood is common, ordinary.

491
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:35,091
I was here there.

492
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:35,758
King.

493
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,301
No, Kiritos.

494
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,304
You are the only king.

495
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,516
An ordinary lion.

496
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:47,061
And you left my son to die.

497
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:48,396
I was injured.

498
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,147
There was no choice, please, Majesty.

499
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,607
You have to believe me.

500
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:53,234
There's no reason to fear me.

501
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,279
I would never harm one of my own.

502
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,155
Thank you, Majesty.

503
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,577
I'll leave that pleasure to them.

504
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:04,871
Majesty!

505
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,123
(growling)

506
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:12,962
(growling)

507
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,469
No one can ever know you ran,

508
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,388
that you ran for your mother.

509
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,725
It never happened,
Taka, do you understand?

510
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,561
But I didn't know, I
was just, I was just scared.

511
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:29,854
It doesn't matter.

512
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,106
We must protect the bloodline.

513
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,608
Protect them with the lie?

514
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,860
Father, that's deceitful.

515
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:39,780
Deceit is a tool of a great king.

516
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:46,495
Taka, it's what kings must do.

517
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:47,747
But I'm not a king.

518
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,041
I'm just your son.

519
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:51,792
Obashek.

520
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:53,252
Shigaru.

521
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:54,879
Obasii.

522
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,715
Shigaru, I'm here.

523
00:36:58,215 --> 00:36:59,133
What did you see?

524
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,302
They're coming this way, Obasii.

525
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,679
Two lions for every one of ours,

526
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,514
each one bigger than the next,

527
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:07,642
but none as mighty as Kirops.

528
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,018
They're terrifying king.

529
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:13,731
Outsiders, stories were all true.

530
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,401
I must protect the bloodline, Eshei.

531
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,153
The future of this pride.

532
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,406
Taka, you are that future.

533
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:23,157
Did you?

534
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:24,450
Dad, what do you mean?

535
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:28,663
I'm sending you away, far from here.

536
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:33,167
You will leave and
start a new life, a new beginning.

537
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,755
I need you to go with him,
Mofasa, to pledge your loyalty.

538
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,299
They'll arrive with the sunrise.

539
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,722
(birds chirping)

540
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,935
Where will we go, Eshei?

541
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:52,979
Without you, I have no home.

542
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:57,817
Mofasa, you and Taka
together, that, that is home.

543
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:58,317
Eshei?

544
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:01,404
Mofasa, look out there, beyond the light.

545
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:02,989
You know what I see?

546
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,449
I see the place
your mother told you about.

547
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,286
A place beyond the river's end,

548
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,997
across the deepest
canyon on the other side

549
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:14,208
of the mountains, a
place beyond the horizon itself.

550
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:19,297
A bright land so green, so perfect

551
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,384
that to see it is to see--

552
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:24,135
Malaylei?

553
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,512
Yes, forever.

554
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,473
My parents spoke of Malaylei often.

555
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,726
My mother told me
it was where we were going.

556
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,019
And don't you see, Mofasa?

557
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,562
You must keep going.

558
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,106
You must continue
your journey toward the light.

559
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:40,317
Please, Eshei, I can't lose you.

560
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:42,820
You have my love always, Mofasa.

561
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,947
But your family is still out there.

562
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:46,073
Waiting for you.

563
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:49,410
I can feel their
presence, and I know you can too.

564
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,039
Go, go, Mofasa.

565
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,207
Find your way home.

566
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,755
(birds chirping)

567
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:06,010
Mother, please forgive me.

568
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:07,595
I beg you.

569
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,055
There's no need, my love.

570
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,308
Daga, your moment of courage will come.

571
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,485
Now both of you go.

572
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:27,740
Go and find your
place in the circle of love.

573
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:41,879
(dramatic music)

574
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:49,220
They left their
family never to see them again?

575
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,138
This story is killing me.

576
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,681
It's toying with my emotion.

577
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:54,809
Here is the worst part.

578
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:55,393
What's that?

579
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,310
A man of crickets.

580
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:57,812
Oh, maybe that's for the best.

581
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,939
I need a bathroom
break before the second act.

582
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:00,815
Everyone wait for me.

583
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:03,526
(dramatic music)

584
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:07,905
I am back.

585
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,365
Tumba, did you wash your hooves?

586
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:10,199
Mm-hmm.

587
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:10,908
Tumba.

588
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:11,951
I did, I did.

589
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:12,618
Tumba.

590
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,537
I'm just gonna walk
on them again right after.

591
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:14,995
Tumba.

592
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:15,955
(grunts)

593
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,874
Rafiki, did the outsiders come?

594
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,627
Yes, and as the hunters led Kirus

595
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:22,920
into the Valley of Kings,

596
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:26,048
Oubasi and Asher stood their ground.

597
00:40:27,424 --> 00:40:30,219
(dramatic music)

598
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:38,978
(roaring)

599
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,022
What one of you is king?

600
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,442
You have no reason to challenge me.

601
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:49,697
Does this look like a challenge king?

602
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,658
There are rooms among lions.

603
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:54,034
Not anymore.

604
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:58,038
While you rule
this, try to build my army.

605
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:02,042
Yours is the last
pride in the Valley of Kings,

606
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:05,379
which means everything the light touches

607
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,298
belongs to thee.

608
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:12,178
There will be one ruler, one lion king.

609
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,473
(roaring)

610
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,186
You say you are the king

611
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:23,647
But you lie around in the shade

612
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,900
Out of shame unafraid

613
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:30,571
The moon cuts the path through the sky

614
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,740
By night or by day

615
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,909
It doesn't obey

616
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,328
And I let you run

617
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,914
You to my son

618
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:44,335
I hope you can run

619
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:49,548
But I'm gonna be the last thing you see

620
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,217
Before you go bye bye

621
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,594
There you go bye bye

622
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:58,682
Climb every tree across land and sea

623
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,267
I make you go bye bye

624
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:02,561
I make you go bye bye

625
00:42:04,521 --> 00:42:06,106
I sing in my glottals

626
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:07,149
Bye bye

627
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,319
Everything the light touches

628
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:15,824
The circle of life is a lie

629
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,412
A pretty way to say
there are predators and prey

630
00:42:21,538 --> 00:42:24,833
That circle of order's a pie

631
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,169
They keep stealing glands

632
00:42:27,544 --> 00:42:29,630
They don't like your chances

633
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,799
And neither do I

634
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,468
You are my pride

635
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,181
You are my pride

636
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:43,936
And I'm gonna be the last thing you see

637
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,729
Before you go bye bye

638
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:47,856
There you go bye bye

639
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:53,028
Climb every tree across land and sea

640
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,822
Until you go bye bye

641
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,949
Where you go bye bye

642
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:01,370
Bye bye for vengeance is mine

643
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:05,666
And I'm the last of my line

644
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,085
I must be soon

645
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:12,756
Bye bye

646
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,092
I make you go bye bye

647
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,095
(grunting)

648
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,973
Bye bye

649
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:21,557
Bye bye

650
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,649
We have to move.

651
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,067
They'll be tracking us.

652
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:33,319
Parker!

653
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:34,194
What if you're wrong?

654
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,071
What if they're okay?

655
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,198
Live in you now.

656
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:39,867
Follow me, brother.

657
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,119
We have to move.

658
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:43,787
Together.

659
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,592
(grunting)

660
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:10,356
Run real faster.

661
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:12,441
Run!

662
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:15,903
Butters.

663
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,029
What's the plan?

664
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,199
Run very fast.

665
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:24,203
(grunting)

666
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,122
This way!

667
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:43,472
Back to the trees.

668
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:44,640
We're trapped.

669
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:45,724
We have to swim.

670
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,393
No, we have to fight.

671
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:48,894
We fight, we die.

672
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:50,813
What if we swim, we drown?

673
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,773
Okay, I didn't want to do this,

674
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,274
but I command you to swim.

675
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:55,442
What?

676
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,861
You've led your
loyalty, I command you to swim.

677
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:00,155
Parker, this is not the time to jump.

678
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,714
Wait, so what have you killed, my son?

679
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:18,257
I did.

680
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,426
This lion with me is nothing but a stray.

681
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:21,260
Let him go.

682
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,387
You see, the other is no stray.

683
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,847
He holds the blood of the problem.

684
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:28,475
The last blood of the king.

685
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:32,604
We are ten for blood.

686
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,414
They're coming.

687
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:52,541
What do we do?

688
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,001
Find the advantage.

689
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,336
We'll have five kids, we're on a rock

690
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:57,963
in the middle of the warcraft.

691
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:00,007
Parker, this is it.

692
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,300
We go for the king.

693
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:12,728
New barter, I'm ready.

694
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,771
Stop, one last thing.

695
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:15,856
You won't.

696
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:16,190
Get up.

697
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:20,694
Parker, this was a bad idea.

698
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:31,330
What was that?

699
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:32,748
What was that?

700
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:38,045
(laughing)

701
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:41,924
What was that?

702
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:42,966
We're alive.

703
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,092
I did it.

704
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:45,427
I said don't.

705
00:46:48,597 --> 00:47:00,150
You understand what I'm saying?

706
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:02,319
( Due arrest! )

707
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:08,408
( This is why I care about you. )

708
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,369
( I promise! )

709
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,791
(explosion)

710
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,920
Okay, okay.

711
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:22,089
No, no more water.

712
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,550
Tell me you can track them down river.

713
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,927
We can track them anywhere.

714
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:29,263
They can run, but they can't hide.

715
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:31,181
(ominous music)

716
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:33,850
So just to be
clear, we're not in this story.

717
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:35,602
It feels a little bit like Giros

718
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,229
is stealing my thunder here.

719
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,855
Yeah, you know, I don't feel seen.

720
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,316
No, there's a lot
of stories with all of us.

721
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:41,942
Tell one of those.

722
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:45,404
One small
suggestion, less childhood drama,

723
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:46,655
more mere catch.

724
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,700
Well, Ziggy, I
know who Chaka is gonna be.

725
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:51,243
Oh, me too.

726
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:54,079
It's so obvious, but maybe
just so we're on the same page.

727
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:55,038
Tell me, is it Simba?

728
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:56,331
Is it me? Oh, Simba.

729
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,083
Am I your bossy?

730
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,752
That makes no sense, but
seriously, I have one question.

731
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:02,754
Am I Chaka?

732
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,507
I did it again.

733
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,259
I did it again.

734
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:11,263
Not that I'm counting,
but I saved your heart again.

735
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:15,225
As much as it cues you
to say it, let's hear a little

736
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:17,060
thank you, you are the one of me.

737
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:20,188
The thank you for
pushing me off a waterfall.

738
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:21,690
Yes, and you're welcome.

739
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,567
Look, it's not my fault.

740
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,485
Crocodile's are simply attracted to you.

741
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,154
Don't, don't say that.

742
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:29,615
(laughing)

743
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,117
I did it again.

744
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:34,328
I did it again.

745
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:35,120
(growling)

746
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:35,954
Mufasa. Shh.

747
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:37,456
Is it, is it them?

748
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:38,665
Is it the outsiders?

749
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:40,834
No, she's right there.

750
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:41,418
Gee.

751
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,962
(suspenseful music)

752
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:45,589
There's no place to run.

753
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:47,215
We have your scent.

754
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:48,884
My scent.

755
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:51,386
I've been stalking you two all night.

756
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:53,680
That's not possible.

757
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:56,683
Then why did I circle
you three times in this wood

758
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:58,894
while you two were
chasing each other's tails?

759
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:05,192
(growling)

760
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:15,243
(growling)

761
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:17,871
(screaming)

762
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:20,624
Not too bad, I said.

763
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:23,460
Yeah, well, I meant to do that.

764
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,879
So. Still think I'm afraid?

765
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:30,509
Why are you following us?

766
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:31,927
I was hoping to find my pride.

767
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,179
What happened? The outsiders happened.

768
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:37,474
A few of us got away,
but you're the only other lions

769
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,058
I've seen.

770
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:40,811
You two better keep moving.

771
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:41,561
Wait, please.

772
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:46,775
My name is Taka, son of Obasi.

773
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:49,194
I know what it's like to lose everything.

774
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:50,821
Come with us, we can help you.

775
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,155
I don't need any help.

776
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:54,991
But you don't have anyone.

777
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:57,786
He does indeed have
someone, thank you very much.

778
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,913
That's Zazu, don't eat him.

779
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,540
You heard her, do not eat me.

780
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,459
As a recent addition
to the king's royal guard,

781
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,546
I must kindly ask you both to move on.

782
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:09,756
Thank you for stopping by.

783
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:12,175
How can your king
hide a bird to protect you?

784
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:13,885
How high can you fly?

785
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:16,513
Look, I needed a scout.

786
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:18,432
Zazu was the last option.

787
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:19,766
Well, next to last.

788
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:22,227
Between Albert, the iguana, and I,

789
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:25,939
his majesty decided
on the underling with wings,

790
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:28,567
and thus, I became the
lead scout for the princess.

791
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:30,694
It's my third day going swimmingly,

792
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:31,737
if I may say so myself.

793
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:33,447
Zorabi, you can say so as well.

794
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:35,240
How far do you
think you'll get with a bird?

795
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,367
How far do you two
geniuses think you'll get

796
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,411
stumbling around running into each other?

797
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:41,329
All the way to Malayle.

798
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:42,873
Malayle is nothing but a myth.

799
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:43,540
It's not a myth.

800
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,333
A circle of life and fairy tale herds.

801
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:47,461
You're chasing
something that doesn't exist.

802
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:49,421
I don't know that Malayle exists,

803
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,840
but right now,
it's the only hope we have.

804
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:52,632
We don't need hope.

805
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,050
We need food.

806
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:57,888
Good job, brother.

807
00:50:58,472 --> 00:50:59,222
Oh, real nice.

808
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,266
(dramatic music)
There's trouble in the trees.

809
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:04,019
My first tree was
trouble, and I am going to pass.

810
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:04,478
You're going?

811
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:05,562
I am staying right here.

812
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:05,854
Thank you.

813
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:06,772
It's yours, Zorabi.

814
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,107
I think it's like
there's dinner headed our way.

815
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:14,821
Zorabi, if I may, he
makes a valid point, your highness.

816
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,115
But on the other
hand, he's a starving lion.

817
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:18,617
He wants to eat
me, so I am slightly torn.

818
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,080
I think that went quite
well, all things considered.

819
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:26,208
(dramatic music)

820
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:30,796
(crowd cheering)

821
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:38,136
And now, Kiara, this is where I come in.

822
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:45,769
(dramatic music)

823
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:48,021
Thank you.

824
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:49,147
Order!

825
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:51,858
We will have order
in the Congress of Baboons.

826
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,693
Tonight, a cheetah came into our trees

827
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,654
for the third night in a row.

828
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:56,947
Almost took one of our own.

829
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:57,864
He was a rafiki for.

830
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,991
He summoned a beast with his dreams.

831
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:03,829
Rafiki and his visions
must be banished once and for all.

832
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:05,372
Rafiki tried to warn you.

833
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:06,873
His dreams conjure our enemies.

834
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,292
He talks to the
spirits, summons the devil.

835
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:10,293
What are you talking about?

836
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,294
He's done it before.

837
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,839
His brother was
chased from these very trees,

838
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,006
never to be seen again.

839
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,424
Rafiki was just a child.

840
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:18,969
A child born with
a leg that does not work,

841
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,136
yet somehow he survived?

842
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:22,597
It was Rafiki who
found water in the dry season.

843
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,183
Who healed you,
Enaki, when you were sick?

844
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,518
He speaks to the insects.

845
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,520
He converses with the moon.

846
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,188
Mzala, you know what will happen

847
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:31,606
if you send him down from the trees.

848
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,860
Here's Amalani,
you are, a curse to us all.

849
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,027
That's not true.

850
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:37,153
He doesn't belong here.

851
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:39,739
All in favor of
banishment, cover one eye.

852
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:44,494
(people chattering)

853
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:50,500
And so, it is time.

854
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:51,543
No, wait.

855
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:53,920
Where will you go?

856
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,339
The way I should have gone long ago,

857
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,427
to find all that was lost, my family.

858
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:02,846
You can't survive on your own.

859
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:04,180
Nobody can.

860
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,766
And yet, here we are.

861
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:09,895
Oh, Rafiki.

862
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:14,691
But I never forget
what the heart has seen.

863
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:23,617
(suspenseful music)

864
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:24,868
(slizing)

865
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:27,120
( INTENSE MUSIC)

866
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:27,287
(pAnne laughs)

867
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:29,015
I don't think you
understand what's about to happen.

868
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,101
There's no place for you to go.

869
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:32,727
I am going forward.

870
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:34,938
I seriously doubt that.

871
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:38,400
It is easy to doubt
everything when you know nothing.

872
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:40,485
Can we get on with this, please?

873
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:44,656
If you take my life,
you will never find Melele.

874
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:46,533
Wait, did you say Melele?

875
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:47,575
That is where I am going.

876
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,119
To ward the light.

877
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:53,081
I've been there many times in my dreams.

878
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:55,166
My brother waits for me there.

879
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,044
I've seen the tree, can picture it.

880
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,755
The two of us together again.

881
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:03,383
And why would
anyone trust a baboon's dream?

882
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:05,385
Sometimes a dream is all you have.

883
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:08,096
The only truth that lives in you,

884
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,807
like the memory of a great king.

885
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:12,017
How did you know?

886
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:15,854
Okay, help us get to
Melele and we will let you live.

887
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:16,980
Do we have a deal?

888
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:17,480
No.

889
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:18,314
What?

890
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:19,357
Why?

891
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:22,277
Rafiki will let you live.

892
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:25,196
I've had enough of this, Parker.

893
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:26,448
Do not eat.

894
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:27,198
Wonderful.

895
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,951
Other misfits
straight were not supposed to eat.

896
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,495
So you expect us to follow this baboon

897
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,831
to a place nobody has ever seen?

898
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:37,042
Ha, I'll be better off alone.

899
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:38,084
Hey, dumbassan.

900
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:42,714
A single stick may
smoke, but it will never burn.

901
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,136
Okay, now that there's five of us,

902
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:50,680
why don't we all go around
and say a fun fact about ourselves?

903
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:51,765
I'll go first.

904
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,893
I once had a crush on a flamingo.

905
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:57,062
We've never said that out loud.

906
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,064
And they're walking away.

907
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:00,982
Yeah, places to go, kingdoms to see.

908
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:02,025
We're busy, let's hustle.

909
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:13,453
Wait, wait, wait.

910
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,121
Now you're the star of this thing?

911
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:18,041
Someone's a little tired
of being sick of banana, huh?

912
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,585
All of a sudden there's
a lot of Rafiki in the story.

913
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,462
You even gave
yourself a long lost brother.

914
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,547
What's next, a funny catch break?

915
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:25,757
Are you gonna be farting next?

916
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:26,424
That's my thing.

917
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,760
You cannot tell the story of Mofapa.

918
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:31,137
We have the story of Rafiki.

919
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:34,390
Now he's even talking
about himself in the third person.

920
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:35,892
Pretty soon he'll have his own fragrance.

921
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:38,436
And I'm the only one
with a fragrance around here.

922
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:40,021
It's called Poba by Poba.

923
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:42,148
From what I hear, it's pretty gross.

924
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:47,278
Mom, Dad, if you can hear me, come home.

925
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,949
Please, come home.

926
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:59,249
(dramatic music)

927
00:56:59,541 --> 00:56:59,749
Okay.

928
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:03,002
Where?

929
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:09,217
Me lately.

930
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:12,011
(burping)

931
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:27,944
(soft music)

932
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:29,863
Rafiki.

933
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:30,947
Hi, Suga.

934
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:31,906
What are you doing?

935
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:32,824
I am fishing.

936
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,326
You're sitting on a
rock with your eyes closed.

937
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,870
My eyes are open.

938
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,663
It is my lids that are closed.

939
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,416
Why am I talking to a bad girl?

940
00:57:41,457 --> 00:57:42,750
I am not a baboon.

941
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,211
I am a mandrel.

942
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:48,339
No offense, but a monkey is a monkey.

943
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:50,175
And a stray is a stray.

944
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:51,176
What's that supposed to mean?

945
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:53,261
It means we are very much the same.

946
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:54,679
(speaking foreign language)

947
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:56,431
We are nothing alike.

948
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:57,807
Take a good look.

949
00:57:58,474 --> 00:57:59,851
I am a lion.

950
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:01,978
The lion who sears water,

951
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:03,605
fears his own reflection,

952
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:06,065
who can't sleep because of what he sees

953
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:07,567
when he closes his eyes.

954
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:08,318
Huh?

955
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,821
You are afraid of your dreams, Mufasa.

956
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,157
Afraid of what you see in them.

957
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,326
I see my parents.

958
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,329
I feel them everywhere.

959
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,372
Of course you do, Mufasa.

960
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,459
You will feel them forever.

961
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:27,962
My mother, I hear her voice.

962
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:32,467
She tells me that we
are on a journey to Malaylay,

963
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:35,803
but I feel so lost without her.

964
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:39,349
Your journey is not a dream, Mufasa.

965
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,309
Your mother is guiding you.

966
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:44,771
And where you are going, a family awaits.

967
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:46,606
(grunts)

968
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:52,070
(speaking foreign language)

969
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:59,035
What are you doing?

970
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:00,620
We're starving.

971
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,121
Because not it's time.

972
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:06,209
Instead, the fish has
agreed to let us share the water.

973
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:09,921
(sighs)

974
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:11,547
(speaking foreign language)

975
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:14,842
Take your smile.

976
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:17,804
I have a report.

977
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:19,389
It's morning.

978
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,599
End of report.

979
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,735
The Earth divided is now a choice,

980
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:34,279
around or down.

981
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,239
The decision is yours.

982
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:41,911
Look out there.

983
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:43,413
Beyond the light,

984
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,541
across the deepest canyon.

985
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,586
Across the deepest canyon.

986
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:52,839
We should go down.

987
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:53,131
Why?

988
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:55,258
Because of some fairy tale.

989
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:56,759
The rocks will hide our tracks.

990
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:58,636
It's safer to go around.

991
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:00,221
I pick up their scent.

992
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,724
The only thing you
picked up is a hallucinating baboon.

993
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:03,683
I am a mentor.

994
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:05,435
This is a waste of time.

995
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:06,936
Close your eyes.

996
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:07,979
What?

997
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:11,858
Tell me what you see, what you feel.

998
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:12,859
There's nothing on the land.

999
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:15,278
No, they're moving
through the bush wallow.

1000
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:15,945
They who?

1001
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:17,447
The females, out front.

1002
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:20,867
Come on, clear
your thoughts, concentrate.

1003
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,618
I am concentrating.

1004
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:30,793
(dramatic music)

1005
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:35,548
He's right.

1006
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:38,718
We have to go down.

1007
01:00:39,635 --> 01:00:41,637
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

1008
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:42,972
We are more than one.

1009
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:46,768
Now the many
sticks will make fire as one.

1010
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:49,854
Come on, we have places to go.

1011
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:51,898
And kingdoms to say.

1012
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:54,067
And kingdoms to say.

1013
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:55,610
What's our plan?

1014
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,697
You wanna go fast, go alone

1015
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:03,701
There's the road, off you go

1016
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:06,829
But if you wanna go far

1017
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:09,165
We go together

1018
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,250
So good, so far

1019
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:12,960
We go together

1020
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:15,546
If your father left you in my care

1021
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:16,964
Whoa, whoa, whoa

1022
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:19,592
And now we're running who knows where

1023
01:01:19,675 --> 01:01:20,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa

1024
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,387
Sometimes you need a bird

1025
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:23,805
Like you and I

1026
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:26,641
I want you to see me through

1027
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:28,309
I land my hair

1028
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,353
You wanna go fast, go alone

1029
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:31,479
Day and night

1030
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:32,480
There's the road

1031
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:33,439
And just like

1032
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:34,273
Off you go

1033
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:35,400
Yeah, all right

1034
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,360
If you wanna go far

1035
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:39,946
We go together

1036
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:42,073
So good, so far

1037
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,825
We go together

1038
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:47,787
I will find my family again

1039
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:51,666
I will walk with you until then

1040
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:55,545
I will walk with you till the end

1041
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:59,215
It's much easier with a friend

1042
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:03,010
I will find my family again

1043
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:06,848
I will walk with you until then

1044
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,893
I will walk with you till the end

1045
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:13,271
It's much easier

1046
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:16,566
Like a cloud and rain

1047
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:21,237
Like a meal in a field of rain

1048
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:26,159
Like a flex of gold in your main shrub

1049
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:28,202
You and me

1050
01:02:28,744 --> 01:02:29,829
Go together

1051
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,747
Cloud and rain

1052
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:37,044
We are living in a great world

1053
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:41,340
The peace of gold in your main shrub

1054
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:43,426
You and me

1055
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:45,094
Go together

1056
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:47,346
My brother waits for a reason to sign

1057
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:48,723
Down anywhere

1058
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:50,600
My brother knows the word

1059
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:52,351
He's like the devil

1060
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:55,646
My brother tends to play decorate

1061
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:59,400
It's big, it's nice to meet you

1062
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:00,610
It's like a man

1063
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:02,445
It's a man

1064
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:04,530
It's a man

1065
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:05,948
It's a man

1066
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:13,122
It's a man No, no, no, no

1067
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:13,831
There we go

1068
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:17,460
No, no, no, no, no

1069
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:19,921
No, no, no, no

1070
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:21,714
We go together

1071
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:23,883
So good, so far

1072
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:25,551
We go together

1073
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:27,094
(cheering)

1074
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:32,016
(laughing)

1075
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,312
As we headed across the great valley,

1076
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:39,524
the hunters tracked our every move.

1077
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,903
Heroes, they are not alone.

1078
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:45,780
They've connected a lioness.

1079
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:47,740
And a monkey.

1080
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:51,035
(roaring)

1081
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:55,873
(roaring)

1082
01:03:58,501 --> 01:03:58,793
Mufasa?

1083
01:03:59,835 --> 01:04:01,712
Mufasa, you have to help me.

1084
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:02,421
Help you how?

1085
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:03,839
It's Sarabi, Mufasa.

1086
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:06,467
She is the light my mother spoke of.

1087
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:07,843
What? She's special.

1088
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:10,680
The most amazing
female I've ever met in my life.

1089
01:04:11,138 --> 01:04:12,223
I don't know what to say to her.

1090
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:13,474
You've spent your life with females.

1091
01:04:14,141 --> 01:04:16,143
Please, tell me what to say.

1092
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:18,229
Just talk to her. Be yourself.

1093
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:20,856
Mufasa, you don't understand.

1094
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:21,899
Myself isn't good enough.

1095
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:25,528
You just know things.

1096
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:28,239
Fine, fine.

1097
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:29,740
Keep it simple.

1098
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:31,784
Ask her a question.

1099
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:33,119
Right, a question?

1100
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:34,495
This is good.

1101
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:38,040
Yeah, try to be confident, disinterested.

1102
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:39,458
But I'm very interested.

1103
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:42,336
Tell her about the flowers.

1104
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:43,379
What flowers?

1105
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:45,298
The valley she comes from.

1106
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:46,966
There's flowers everywhere.

1107
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:50,636
Duck flowers, long stems.

1108
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:52,972
It's absolutely beautiful.

1109
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:54,724
How do you know that?

1110
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:57,643
When she passes, I
can smell them on her fur.

1111
01:04:58,894 --> 01:04:59,145
Okay.

1112
01:05:00,896 --> 01:05:01,939
Flowers, disinterested.

1113
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,817
And here's the
most important thing, okay?

1114
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:07,820
Listen when she speaks.

1115
01:05:08,946 --> 01:05:10,114
Males have trouble with that one.

1116
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:11,198
Sorry.

1117
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:13,075
What did you say?

1118
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:15,286
Really?

1119
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:16,662
You know what I mean?

1120
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:18,164
I heard you, brother.

1121
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,666
I'm gonna make you proud.

1122
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:25,921
Oh.

1123
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,221
It's very hard, isn't it?

1124
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:35,264
Yep.

1125
01:05:37,516 --> 01:05:37,725
Oh.

1126
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,269
I love listening.

1127
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:41,312
Okay.

1128
01:05:41,979 --> 01:05:43,230
I'm listening right now.

1129
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:44,065
To what?

1130
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,024
What you just said.

1131
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:46,609
I am.

1132
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:49,654
You smell like a duck.

1133
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:49,987
What?

1134
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:50,696
Flower.

1135
01:05:51,947 --> 01:05:52,990
A duck flower.

1136
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:55,409
How do you know about those flowers?

1137
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:55,951
I...

1138
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:58,663
Well, I inhaled you with my nose.

1139
01:05:59,246 --> 01:06:00,247
I can smell them.

1140
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:02,958
That's amazing.

1141
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:05,795
Our valley was full of those flowers,

1142
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:08,255
thousands of them,
as far as the eye could see.

1143
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:11,425
It was the most beautiful place, Taka.

1144
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:14,053
Did he just say she smells like a duck?

1145
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:16,722
And you call me a baboon.

1146
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:33,823
I shouldn't be here.

1147
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:35,950
The migration patterns are broken.

1148
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,410
I don't understand.

1149
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:37,618
I'm sorry, sir.

1150
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:38,994
This is not a drill.

1151
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:42,748
Just to be clear, I
never signed up for this.

1152
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,376
It's okay.

1153
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:46,210
It's safe.

1154
01:06:46,877 --> 01:06:48,170
They're on the other side.

1155
01:06:49,213 --> 01:06:49,839
No!

1156
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:51,507
They can just jump across.

1157
01:06:51,924 --> 01:06:52,883
We're trapped.

1158
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:54,301
What do we do?

1159
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:56,262
The elephants will fight with us.

1160
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:57,430
And why would they do that?

1161
01:06:57,471 --> 01:06:59,682
Because I'm going to ask them.

1162
01:07:00,015 --> 01:07:00,891
Got a better idea?

1163
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:04,270
Yes, Mr. Ask questions first.

1164
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:05,396
Get ready to run.

1165
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:06,897
Um...

1166
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:07,982
Where is she going?

1167
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:09,066
Hello?

1168
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,401
Listen to me, please.

1169
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:11,485
We need your help.

1170
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:12,653
Can you talk with me?

1171
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:13,028

They're coming!

Trombie!

Wait wait!

1179
01:07:24,039 --> 01:07:26,417
Just go for the hide!

1180

Like I said, get ready to run!

1181
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:32,757
Run!

1182
01:07:41,056 --> 01:07:43,225
Run!

1183
01:07:43,851 --> 01:07:45,311
Get to the trees!

1184
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,062
Why are you running?

1185
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:13,756
Run!

1186
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:18,177
You are behind us!

1187
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:19,053
Hold on!

1188
01:08:19,553 --> 01:08:20,179
I found you!

1189
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:30,856

Do not reach me.

(screaming)

1195
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:10,271
I got you, I got you.

1196
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:12,398
Sarabi, I got you.

1197
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:22,741
That's right, run
along little kitty cats.

1198
01:09:23,617 --> 01:09:24,910
Meow, meow.

1199
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:27,538
Thank you, my friend.

(speaking foreign language)

1206
01:10:10,122 --> 01:10:12,124
Alive, she's alive.

1207
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:19,590
Why are you all looking at me?

1208
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:21,508
You were thrown from the tree.

1209
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:23,636
She saved your life.

1210
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:26,263
Who?

1211
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:29,808
Taka, Taka saved you.

1212
01:10:30,225 --> 01:10:31,769
Isn't that right, brother?

1213
01:10:35,981 --> 01:10:36,774
You saved me?

1214
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:40,235
Well, I had had to do something.

1215
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:41,320
Thank you.

1216
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:43,656
We're lucky.

1217
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:47,034
Those bees almost killed us all.

1218
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:48,827
Those bees saved our lives.

1219
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:49,620
Ah, really?

1220
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:53,332
Because it felt
like an elephant stampede.

1221
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:54,416
We're alive, aren't we?

1222
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,793
The elephants would have fought with us.

1223
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:58,963
We're lions, nobody
will fight with us, not out here.

1224
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:04,093
(speaking foreign language)

1225
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:08,931
Where's it going?

1226
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:11,767
Beyond the horizon itself.

1227
01:11:12,559 --> 01:11:16,188
(speaking foreign language)

1228
01:11:16,188 --> 01:11:17,815
Mufasa, thank you.

01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:25,656
(thunder rumbling)

1230
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:34,999
Rafiki, who, who are the outsiders?

1231
01:11:35,874 --> 01:11:39,086
Well, the
outsiders come from many prides,

1232
01:11:39,086 --> 01:11:41,505
but when they are born, they are hated

1233
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:44,299
because they are
different from their tribe.

1234
01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:45,884
Like you mean your tribe?

1235
01:11:46,301 --> 01:11:47,720
Yes, just like me.

1236
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:49,263
But Rafiki?

1237
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:50,097
Yes.

1238
01:11:50,347 --> 01:11:52,016
Why do they want to hurt everybody?

1239
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:56,603
Sometimes when the
people most like you don't love you,

1240
01:11:56,603 --> 01:11:59,773
it is a hurt that
can cause the greatest pain.

1241
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:04,695
And this pain can
lead you to hate everything.

1242
01:12:05,195 --> 01:12:07,531
I'm glad that
didn't happen to you, Rafiki.

1243
01:12:07,948 --> 01:12:10,159
Yes, my child, I'm glad too.

1244
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:12,911
Um, hi, we're here too.

1245
01:12:12,953 --> 01:12:15,122
Yeah, why are you
leaving us outside this story?

1246
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:17,750
Well, I'm pretty sure
we are the ultimate outtiles.

1247
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:18,333
Come on.

1248
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:19,835
Yeah, we've always been misunderstood.

1249
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:21,336
I contain both of you.

1250
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:25,132
(dramatic music)

1251
01:12:27,342 --> 01:12:29,511
There are many ways to be there,

1252
01:12:30,554 --> 01:12:32,681
but this, for us.

1253
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:35,768
(dramatic music)

1254
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:10,886
(dramatic music) Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1255
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:12,179
Hey, Rafiki?

1256
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:14,181
What are you doing?

1257
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:18,060
I am confirming my vision, Fasa.

1258
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:23,107
Can I ask you something, Rafiki?

1259
01:13:24,024 --> 01:13:24,233
Hmm?

1260
01:13:24,525 --> 01:13:26,318
How many of your visions have come true?

1261
01:13:27,611 --> 01:13:29,154
So far, none.

1262
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:29,696
None?

1263
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:31,323
But it's not what I see.

1264
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:32,449
It's what I feel.

1265
01:13:33,408 --> 01:13:37,746
But how do you know
when you should follow a feeling?

1266
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:40,040
Millele exists.

1267
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:43,210
I feel it in here.

1268
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:47,089
The question is,
what do you feel, Mufasa?

1269
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:49,550
In they.

1270
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:52,427
(dramatic music)

1271
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:06,692
(dramatic music)

1272
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:10,737
Weather is shifting.

1273
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:12,197
There's not enough fresh snow.

1274
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:15,117
Hey, if the outsiders find our tracks,

1275
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:16,869
they'll follow them to Millele.

1276
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:19,746
Zazu, only you can help us.

1277
01:14:19,746 --> 01:14:21,748
Are you quite sure about that?

1278
01:14:22,082 --> 01:14:23,667
Now, I was actually
thinking that Rafiki looks

1279
01:14:23,667 --> 01:14:24,918
all pretty handy and with the stick--

1280
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,379
Zazu, you can use
your wings to cover our tracks

1281
01:14:27,379 --> 01:14:29,339
as we head up the
mountain without leaving a trace.

1282
01:14:29,923 --> 01:14:31,383
Hey, you can do this.

1283
01:14:31,758 --> 01:14:32,968
Oh, yeah.

1284
01:14:34,052 --> 01:14:35,095
Yes, sir, you're right.

1285
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:35,929
I've got this.

1286
01:14:37,764 --> 01:14:39,224
(dramatic music)

1287
01:14:39,391 --> 01:14:40,809
Okay, this is me.

1288
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:42,144
Getting to the frozen mountain.

1289
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,771
And the one horned
field charge with saving future.

1290
01:14:45,522 --> 01:14:46,023
Oh, mummy!

1291
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:50,903
Oh, oh, my life, that's cold.

1292
01:14:53,363 --> 01:15:04,041
(dramatic music) (thunder rumbling)

1293
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:05,167
(thunder rumbling)

1294
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:06,668
What's happening?

1295
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,962
We can't keep stopping.

1296
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:12,257
Somehow, they have
covered their tracks in the snow.

1297
01:15:13,592 --> 01:15:14,676
It's not possible.

1298
01:15:15,093 --> 01:15:17,304
Majesty, they could
be anywhere on this mountain.

1299
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:18,847
Then find them now.

1300
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:23,560
Zazu, zazu, zazu, zazu, zazu, zazu.

1301
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:25,354
(dramatic music)

1302
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:29,358
I have a report.

1303
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:32,819
The outsiders are completely lost.

1304
01:15:33,278 --> 01:15:34,154
Well played, Mufasa.

1305
01:15:34,529 --> 01:15:35,447
Great job, Zazu.

1306
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:36,573
And as per usual.

1307
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:37,866
I knew you could do it.

1308
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:38,784
We did it.

1309
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:40,619
We did it.

1310
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:42,871
No, you did it.

1311
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,581
Great thinking, Mufasa.

1312
01:15:45,123 --> 01:15:46,541
Now, we're all rubbing off on each other.

1313
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:48,043
Partly normal thing to do.

1314
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:49,461
Who wants to rub against us?

1315
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:50,379
No one.

1316
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:51,380
I'm leaving now.

1317
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:52,256
Scout ahead.

1318
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:56,301
(dramatic music)

1319
01:15:56,301 --> 01:15:57,719
(thunder rumbling)

1320
01:15:57,719 --> 01:15:57,886
(grunting)

1321
01:15:59,346 --> 01:16:05,394
(laughing)

1322
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:08,814
I got you, Rufasa.

1323
01:16:09,439 --> 01:16:09,940
Hey.

1324
01:16:10,357 --> 01:16:10,857
I got you.

1325
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:11,858
Do not do that.

1326
01:16:12,317 --> 01:16:13,235
Yeah, I got you.

1327
01:16:16,154 --> 01:16:16,905
(dramatic music)

1328
01:16:17,155 --> 01:16:19,032
Mufasa.

1329
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:21,827
I got you.

1330
01:16:23,578 --> 01:16:25,080
(dramatic music)

1331
01:16:25,289 --> 01:16:26,290
I'm sorry.

1332
01:16:26,331 --> 01:16:30,544
(dramatic music)

1333
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:38,802
Heading in the
shadows, downwind, right afoot.

1334
01:16:39,803 --> 01:16:41,596
Interesting hunting style, Mufasa.

1335
01:16:42,055 --> 01:16:45,475
We have to eat something
before we take on that descent.

1336
01:16:45,517 --> 01:16:47,728
Unfortunately,
there's nothing to hunt up here.

1337
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:48,687
See under that rock?

1338
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:51,398
There's a sieve about to leave his den.

1339
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:54,276
Of course you can
smell a sieve hidden in the snow.

1340
01:16:54,318 --> 01:16:57,571
You, the lion who can do anything.

1341
01:16:58,697 --> 01:16:59,781
What's that supposed to mean?

1342
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:02,367
It means I see you, Mufasa.

1343
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:04,661
I don't know what you're talking about.

1344
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:08,457
Now that part I
believe, because smart as you are,

1345
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:11,168
you have a way of
seeing everything but yourself.

1346
01:17:11,626 --> 01:17:12,544
What is this?

1347
01:17:13,587 --> 01:17:14,671
What is this, Sarabi?

1348
01:17:15,172 --> 01:17:18,300
There is a sievet in the
snow right where you said it would be,

1349
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,427
and you smelled
the outsiders in the wind,

1350
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:23,180
which means you're the one
who smelled the flowers on my fur.

1351
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:23,263
It was a lucky guess.

1352
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:26,808
You can smell the
exact flower from my valley.

1353
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:28,643
No, that's not possible.

1354
01:17:28,643 --> 01:17:29,436
You saved me.

1355
01:17:30,103 --> 01:17:32,939
Held me, covered me
in a stamp, he comforted me.

1356
01:17:32,939 --> 01:17:33,899
No, it was talking.

1357
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:34,566
I got you.

1358
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:35,901
I got you, Sarabi.

1359
01:17:35,942 --> 01:17:37,486
I'm here to protect him.

1360
01:17:37,527 --> 01:17:38,320
That was you?

1361
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,614
I was lost in the water and he found me.

1362
01:17:40,614 --> 01:17:41,573
My brother saved her.

1363
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:43,283
I sensed it from the beginning.

1364
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:45,369
His blood is the blood of the king.

1365
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:45,911
Mufasa.

1366
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:47,412
That is his destiny.

1367
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:50,290
No, his destiny was to save you.

1368
01:17:50,874 --> 01:17:51,291
Okay.

1369
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:55,670
Now tell me it's you.

1370
01:18:09,309 --> 01:18:10,644
Ever since you appeared,

1371
01:18:12,437 --> 01:18:15,399
I've been running
through something deep inside,

1372
01:18:15,732 --> 01:18:17,192
and it's worse than I feared.

1373
01:18:18,902 --> 01:18:21,947
Cause I look in
your eyes and I can't hide

1374
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:23,281
I push you away

1375
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:24,991
Don't push me away

1376
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:28,120
But the feelings
come back just twice as strong

1377
01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:29,788
I don't know what to say

1378
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,415
I know just what to say

1379
01:18:31,623 --> 01:18:34,334
But I know that I'm right where I belong

1380
01:18:34,626 --> 01:18:36,461
Way you know just where to be

1381
01:18:36,628 --> 01:18:38,004
I don't know

1382
01:18:38,505 --> 01:18:39,673
Move the way you see

1383
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:40,757
You see me

1384
01:18:40,841 --> 01:18:42,843
The way you feel when you're near

1385
01:18:43,802 --> 01:18:47,264
Beside me, don't hide me in court

1386
01:18:47,305 --> 01:18:50,517
Tell me it's you, I know it's you

1387
01:18:50,767 --> 01:18:52,227
What do I say, where do I go

1388
01:18:52,352 --> 01:18:53,812
How do I know you feel the same

1389
01:18:54,312 --> 01:18:56,898
Tell me it's you, I know it's you

1390
01:18:57,149 --> 01:18:58,567
Quiet and low, letting it go

1391
01:18:58,775 --> 01:19:00,026
Letting you know it's in me

1392
01:19:00,318 --> 01:19:01,695
Every year that I roll

1393
01:19:03,488 --> 01:19:06,241
I remind myself not to overstay

1394
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:08,160
Every time I find home

1395
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:12,581
Something happens to take that home away

1396
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:14,416
Don't you see what I've seen

1397
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:16,042
I see you

1398
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:19,004
As you meet with the
strength that shines right through

1399
01:19:19,504 --> 01:19:21,798
Move like a queen, true queen

1400
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:25,510
Don't let anything take me away from you

1401
01:19:26,052 --> 01:19:28,430
Tell me it's you, I know it's you

1402
01:19:28,805 --> 01:19:30,098
Say it again, say it again

1403
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:31,725
Tell me I'll always be with you

1404
01:19:32,225 --> 01:19:34,603
Tell me it's you, I know it's you

1405
01:19:34,978 --> 01:19:36,354
Say it again, say it again

1406
01:19:36,521 --> 01:19:37,772
Tell me you're always with me

1407
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:39,816
You know just where to be

1408
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:41,234
Now I know

1409
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:42,986
Move the way you see

1410
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:44,029
I see you

1411
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:46,323
As you feel like you and you and me

1412
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:49,701
Beside me, beside me

1413
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:52,037
Say it again, say it again, say it again

1414
01:19:52,245 --> 01:19:53,663
Tell me the world won't end again

1415
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:55,165
Say it again, say it again

1416
01:19:55,248 --> 01:19:56,791
Tell me the words I wanna hear

1417
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,293
Say it again, say it again

1418
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:00,253
Open your eyes and here we come

1419
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:05,967
I know it's you

1420
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:12,307
I know it's you

1421
01:20:39,292 --> 01:20:44,673
You know I love her, my brother

1422
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:50,303
There's nothing we keep from each other

1423

Save your life, this is how you behave

1424
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:03,608
What do I do, what does it mean

1425
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:05,277
How do I ever wanna see what I see

1426
01:21:05,902 --> 01:21:08,446
He was my kin, she was my queen

1427

Now it's broken
forever and now it's broken forever

1428
01:21:10,991 --> 01:21:13,034
And the caller is you, she knows it's you

1429
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:15,412
What did you say to her, what did you do

1430
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:17,831
I'm next in line, now she should be mine

1431
01:21:18,081 --> 01:21:20,333
Ha, are the answers
laughing? I believe them

1432
01:21:20,333 --> 01:21:22,460
What would they say, father is gone

1433
01:21:22,794 --> 01:21:24,588
Not before giving me strength, Lord

1434
01:21:25,088 --> 01:21:27,132
He never trusted you, didn't know

1435
01:21:27,465 --> 01:21:29,259
You've been training me sir

1436
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:31,761
For when you were drowning I could die

1437
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:33,263
I can do life with you lived in my day

Behind you and round me, tumbling down

Trying to escape what I cannot forget

1440

I am a brother no
longer, it's over in time

Now all I have is
shame and it's way that I can't

Out

This is a tool of a grateful king.

There wasn't much
to eat on this mountain.

01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:00,850
Until now.

1446

Tell me, how did
you cut me attractions, no?

You will help us.

You think we need
help from a wounded coward.

I may hold the blood of a king.

But it was Mufasa who killed your son.

It was Mufasa who trapped you up here.

Outspotted you at every turn.

1456

Malele.

Ah, well, tell that to the monkey.

He leads them to it.

clinging to the side of a mountain.

Because of Mufasa, I have no father.

He did this.

1471

Yes. You lost a father.

01:38:58,474 --> 01:38:59,725
الأسد الأخير.

1663
01:39:00,684 --> 01:39:04,146
لقد حان وقت انقراضهم وسنبدأ بالأصغر سنا.

1664
01:39:14,281 --> 01:39:16,825
الأرض سوف تهتز.

لا، لا، أنا لست كذلك.

01:43:21,403 --> 01:43:22,571
أيها الملك ارفع رأسك.

1680
01:43:23,196 --> 01:43:25,407
أنا فقط-- لا، لا، لا مزيد من الملوك.

من فضلكم من فضلكم ارفعوا رؤوسكم.

01:43:30,287 --> 01:43:34,333
ولكن يا موفاسا، لقد جمعتهما معًا.

01:43:35,208 --> 01:43:39,171
لقد جعلتهم يرون أنفسهم، ما اعتبروه غير قابل للرؤية.

لا يوجد شيء أكثر ملكيًا.

لا يا رفيقي.

أنا لست ملكًا، ولا من الدم الملكي.

ألا ترى يا أخي أن الأمر ليس كما كنت؟

هذا ما أصبحت عليه.

ولكن كيف يمكن أن يكون ذلك؟

1700
01:45:00,293 --> 01:45:06,299
كان لي ابن اسمه موفاسا أخذه مني طوفان عظيم.

01:45:07,134 --> 01:45:07,342
الأم؟

1702
01:45:09,302 --> 01:45:14,766
لم أتوقف أبدًا عن الأمل، مؤمنًا بابني.

1703
01:45:18,311 --> 01:45:19,646
حلمت بهذه اللحظة.

والآن أصبح حقيقة.

أين الأب؟

إنه يعيش في داخلك الآن.

إنه يعيش فيك.

لقد حلمت دائمًا بأننا سنكون معًا مرة أخرى.

1711
01:45:58,310 --> 01:46:01,646
وعرفت أنه سيكون في ميليلي.

موفاسا، من فضلك سامحني.

01:46:18,580 --> 01:46:20,832
يجب عليك نفيه، سايا.

1716
01:46:22,459 --> 01:46:26,963
ما دام أنا الملك، فسوف يكون لأخي مكان هنا.

أوه أخي، أنا آسف جدًا.

01:46:32,219 --> 01:46:33,261
لكن سايا لن تقول اسمك مرة أخرى أبدًا.

01:46:33,261 --> 01:46:41,978
لا أستطيع. لن أفعل.

ومع ذلك، ليس لدي أي اقتراحات.
