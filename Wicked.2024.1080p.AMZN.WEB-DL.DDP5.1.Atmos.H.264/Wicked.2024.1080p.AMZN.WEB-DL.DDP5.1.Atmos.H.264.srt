No.

Whoo! Yep.

184
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,932
Well, this has been fun.

185
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:13,934
As you can imagine,
I have much to attend to

186
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:15,936
with the Wizard's
unexpected departure.

187
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:20,374
So if there are no further
questions, I'm gonna go.

188
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:24,613
Glinda, is it true
you were her friend?

189
00:12:24,713 --> 00:12:26,180
What?

190
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,549
Sorry. One sec.

191
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:30,552
What?

192
00:12:30,652 --> 00:12:33,420
Is it true you were her friend?

193
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:38,892
Friend?

194
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:41,630
Yes.

195
00:12:42,997 --> 00:12:45,734
I-I mean, I did know her.

196
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:49,604
That is,

197
00:12:49,704 --> 00:12:51,872
our paths did cross.

198
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:03,851
At school.

199
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:09,823
<i>But you must understand,</i>

200
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:12,426
<i>it was a long time ago.</i>

201
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,342
Hi!

202
00:14:01,442 --> 00:14:03,077
-Hi! -Galinda, hi!

203
00:14:04,813 --> 00:14:06,648
Oh, we're so proud of you.

204
00:14:06,748 --> 00:14:08,115
Oh, thank you.

205
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,819
I love you. Just remember,
it's not goodbye,

206
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:12,152
-it's farewell.
-We love you.

207
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:13,588
-You have all your cases?
-Yes.

208
00:14:13,688 --> 00:14:15,089
-And you will write?
-Yes.

209
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:16,524
-I love you. It's that time.
-Bye, darling.

210
00:14:16,624 --> 00:14:17,958
Miss you already.

211
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:19,594
Popsicle, board the boat.

212
00:14:19,694 --> 00:14:21,995
They are gonna miss me so much.

213
00:14:22,096 --> 00:14:23,798
My parents don't even
know I left.

214
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:27,434
Uh, uh...

215
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:28,969
I'm Boq.

216
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:31,238
I'm from Munchkinland.

00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:33,006
Hmm.

218
00:14:33,107 --> 00:14:34,676
I know we don't really know
each other yet, but I...

219
00:14:34,776 --> 00:14:36,578
You know what I believe, Bick?

220
00:14:36,678 --> 00:14:39,012
It's Bick-- It's Boq.

221
00:14:39,113 --> 00:14:43,283
That strangers are just people
I've never met.

222
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:46,387
Hmm.

223
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:48,222

What?

236
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,809
What are you staring at?

237
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:42,777
Do I have something in my teeth?

238
00:15:42,877 --> 00:15:45,613
No, it's just...

239
00:15:45,713 --> 00:15:47,314
You're green.

240
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,251
I am.

241
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:59,794
Fine. Let's get this over with.

242
00:15:59,894 --> 00:16:01,328
No, I am not seasick.

243
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:05,098
No, I did not eat grass
as a child.

244
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,102
And, yes,
I've always been green.

245
00:16:09,804 --> 00:16:15,008
Well, I, for one, am so sorry

246
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:19,346
that you have been forced
to live with...

247
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:20,782
this.

248
00:16:20,882 --> 00:16:22,216
Is that so?

249
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:24,284
Yes.

250
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:28,957
And it is my intention
to major in sorcery.

251
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:30,257
So, if at some point,

252
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:33,661
you wanted to address the, um...

253
00:16:33,761 --> 00:16:35,395
problem...

254
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:36,965
Problem.

255
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:39,299
...perhaps I could help.

256
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,201
She's so good.

257
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:43,403
-She's so good.
-You're so good. We love you.

258
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,009
Thank you.

259
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,046
All right.

260
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:55,082
Offering to help someone
that you don't know

261
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:57,886
with skills that you don't have.

262
00:16:57,986 --> 00:17:00,153
I'm sure everyone
is duly impressed.

263
00:17:00,254 --> 00:17:02,289
I could care less
what others think.

264
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:03,290
Couldn't.

265
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,291
What?

266
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:06,861
You "couldn't" care less
what other people think.

267
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:09,731
Though I... I doubt that.

268
00:17:09,831 --> 00:17:11,599
Elphaba!

269
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:13,668
Elphaba Thropp!

270
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:16,804
Ah. This is my younger sister,
Nessarose.

271
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:20,040
As you can see, she's
a perfectly acceptable color.

272
00:17:22,744 --> 00:17:26,014
Stop making
a spectacle of yourself.

273
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:27,515
I was trying to be nice.

274
00:17:27,615 --> 00:17:29,017
You were so nice
and good and correct.

275
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:30,083
-Did I do something bad?
I was... -No.

276
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:31,351
How did that come across?

277
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:33,021
I don't see color, by the way.

278
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,155
My precious little girl.

279
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:37,491
Father.

280
00:17:38,826 --> 00:17:40,562
A parting gift.

281
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,201
Mother's jeweled shoes.

282
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:52,040
So they can all see
how beautiful you are

283
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:54,308
right down to your toes.

284
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:56,276
Thank you.

285
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:59,112
Thank you so much.
I love them.

286
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:00,882
Let me put them
with your boxes.

287
00:18:00,982 --> 00:18:03,150
Of course.

288
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,221
I shouldn't have
sprouted off like that.

289
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,358
No, you shouldn't have.

290
00:18:12,727 --> 00:18:13,928
Today is...

291
00:18:14,028 --> 00:18:16,096
The start of your new life.

292
00:18:17,632 --> 00:18:19,033
New friends.

293
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:21,234
New books.

294
00:18:22,904 --> 00:18:24,038
I'm excited for you.

295
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:25,607
I'll miss you.

296
00:18:26,808 --> 00:18:28,141
No, you won't.

297
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:29,811
You'll be having
too good a time.

298
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:37,018
All new Shiz students,

299
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:38,886
please report to the quad.

300
00:18:38,987 --> 00:18:40,622
-Don't help me.
-Don't help her.

301
00:18:43,891 --> 00:18:45,125
She'll be fine.

302
00:18:45,927 --> 00:18:48,195
All new Shiz students,

303
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:51,498
please report to the quad.

304
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:56,904
-Oh, hey. Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

305
00:18:57,005 --> 00:18:58,271
Nice to meet you, too.

306
00:18:58,372 --> 00:18:59,974
We should head back.

307
00:19:00,074 --> 00:19:01,709
-Go with her.
-What?

308
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:04,211
Just until she's safely settled
in her room.

309
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:07,081
Make sure she has everything
she needs.

310
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,516
Father, she's on her own now.

311
00:19:08,616 --> 00:19:10,250
-I can't just...
-Just stop jabbering!

312
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,887
Just do what I say!

313
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:16,557
If anything
should happen to her...

314
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:27,434
Thank you for your contribution

315
00:19:27,535 --> 00:19:29,202
to our university.

316
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:32,674
And rounding out
the rest of our faculty,

317
00:19:32,774 --> 00:19:37,344
we have two scholars eminent
in their respective fields

318
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:40,515
of forestry and agriculture,

319
00:19:40,615 --> 00:19:44,652
as well as Professor Mombi
of the Biological Arts,

320
00:19:44,752 --> 00:19:47,722
and, of course, the head
of our history department,

321
00:19:47,822 --> 00:19:48,856
Dr. Dillamond.

322
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,095
You know, except for
our wonderful Wizard,

323
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:57,065
true magic has become
all too rare,

324
00:19:57,165 --> 00:19:58,533
which is why

325
00:19:58,633 --> 00:20:01,368
we are privileged
to have our esteemed

326
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:05,405
Dean of Sorcery Studies,
Madame Morrible.

327
00:20:17,685 --> 00:20:19,252
Oh.

328
00:20:22,123 --> 00:20:23,991
Could you...

329
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:26,961
I don't...

330
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:28,029
Oh, my goodness,
it's really her.

331
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:39,807
Welcome, new students.

332
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:44,145
And congratulotions for having
been accepted to Shiz.

333
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:47,782
Whether you'll be studying
law, logic

334
00:20:47,882 --> 00:20:48,750
or linguification,

335
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:53,187
I know I speak
for my fellow faculty members

336
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,158
when I say we have nothing

337
00:20:57,257 --> 00:21:01,562
but the highest hopes
for some of you.

338
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:07,135
And now, Miss Coddle,
if you please.

339
00:21:07,235 --> 00:21:09,070
I am Miss Coddle,

340
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,271
Head Shizstress.

341
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:13,908
And these are
your dormitory designations

342
00:21:14,008 --> 00:21:16,309
and room assignments.

343
00:21:17,645 --> 00:21:21,249
Good luck, and welcome to Shiz!

344
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:33,995
Madame Morrible, hi.

345
00:21:34,095 --> 00:21:36,164
I am Galinda Upland.

346
00:21:36,264 --> 00:21:38,398
Of the Upper Uplands.

347
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:40,868
If this is regarding
room assignments...

348
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:42,302
Oh, thank you so much,

349
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:43,805
but I've already been assigned
a private suite.

350
00:21:43,905 --> 00:21:46,406
This is about my application
to your sorcery seminar.

351
00:21:46,507 --> 00:21:48,209
Perhaps you recall my essay,

352
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:50,778
"Magic Wands,
Need They Have a Point?"

353
00:21:50,878 --> 00:21:54,615
Well, dear, I don't teach
my seminar every semester.

354
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:58,152
Of course, if someone very
special were to come along...

355
00:21:58,252 --> 00:21:59,921
Exactly.

356
00:22:00,021 --> 00:22:02,857
This is why I wanted
to talk to you. Um...

357
00:22:02,957 --> 00:22:04,692
We'll be in touch.

358
00:22:05,293 --> 00:22:07,094
There you are.

359
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:08,596
Mwah!

360
00:22:08,696 --> 00:22:10,198
-Miss Nessarose, isn't it?
-Yes.

361
00:22:10,298 --> 00:22:11,498
-The Governor's daughter?
-Mm-hmm.

362
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:16,170
Oh. How tragically
beautiful you are.

363
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,139
It is such an honor to...

364
00:22:20,308 --> 00:22:21,441
I'm the other daughter.

365
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:23,311
I'm beautifully tragic.

366
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:26,147
The other daughter?

367
00:22:26,247 --> 00:22:27,915
Elphaba, what are you doing?

368
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:30,251
Well, I wasn't made aware.

369
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:32,753
I know. I was just...

370
00:22:32,854 --> 00:22:33,921
Not to fret.

371
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:36,456
Just a slight gulch.

372
00:22:37,158 --> 00:22:39,861
We'll find someplace
to hide you.

373
00:22:39,961 --> 00:22:43,064
I mean "house" you.

374
00:22:43,164 --> 00:22:44,899
That won't be necessary.

375
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:46,000
I'm not enrolled.

376
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,201
Oh, good.

377
00:22:47,301 --> 00:22:48,803
Why are you still here?

378
00:22:48,903 --> 00:22:50,504
I'm sorry, Nessa.
Father insisted that...

379
00:22:50,605 --> 00:22:52,340
Oh, the Governor made
his concern

380
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:53,875
-for your sister
quite apparent. -Wait.

381
00:22:53,975 --> 00:22:56,644
Please assure him
I am honored to help her.

382
00:22:56,744 --> 00:22:58,112
Well, she doesn't need
your help.

383
00:22:58,212 --> 00:22:59,614
Stop. I just need
to find my room.

384
00:22:59,714 --> 00:23:01,849
I'll bring you there myself.

385
00:23:01,949 --> 00:23:03,684
-Miss Coddle, I-I don't
think you... -Now...

386
00:23:03,784 --> 00:23:05,219
Miss Coddle, I promised
my father that I...

387
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:07,922
-I don't want help.
-Can you... Stop, Miss Coddle.

388
00:23:08,022 --> 00:23:09,590
-She can do it alone.
-I'm fine.

389
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,424
-Please let go.
-Please, you don't understand!

390
00:23:11,525 --> 00:23:13,194
Stop!

391
00:23:13,294 --> 00:23:15,296
Let her go!

392
00:23:51,933 --> 00:23:55,236
This was my chance,
my new start.

393
00:23:55,836 --> 00:23:58,306
I'm sorry, Nessa. I just...

394
00:23:58,406 --> 00:23:59,573
I didn't...

395
00:23:59,674 --> 00:24:03,611
Magic is merely
the mind's attempt

396
00:24:03,711 --> 00:24:07,682
to wrap itself around
the impossible.

397
00:24:07,782 --> 00:24:09,984
Yes...

398
00:24:10,084 --> 00:24:11,552
that was me.

399
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,991
To prepare you to expect
the unexpected

400
00:24:17,091 --> 00:24:19,427
here at Shiz.

401
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:27,735
-Did you visually see that?
-Yeah.

402
00:24:27,835 --> 00:24:29,603
I simply must get
into her seminar.

403
00:24:29,704 --> 00:24:34,008
And speaking of the unexpected.

404
00:24:40,181 --> 00:24:42,783
Which of you would volunteer

405
00:24:42,883 --> 00:24:44,318
-to share a room with...
--Ow.

406
00:24:44,418 --> 00:24:46,053
Ow.

407
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:47,922
Madame Morrible, um...

408
00:24:48,022 --> 00:24:49,123
Thank you, dear.

409
00:24:49,223 --> 00:24:51,726
That is very good of you.

410
00:24:51,826 --> 00:24:52,893
What?

411
00:24:52,994 --> 00:24:53,894
Miss?

412
00:24:53,995 --> 00:24:55,796
Elphaba.

413
00:24:58,466 --> 00:25:00,034
Elphaba.

414
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:03,637
You can room with Miss Galinda.

415
00:25:03,738 --> 00:25:04,939
Wh-What? I... What?

416
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,909
Now, go. All of you, go.

417
00:25:10,978 --> 00:25:12,013
Go.

418
00:25:12,113 --> 00:25:14,181
And you.

419
00:25:14,281 --> 00:25:15,916
Come with me.

420
00:25:16,017 --> 00:25:17,018
Of course.

421
00:25:17,118 --> 00:25:18,652
Not you.

422
00:25:20,988 --> 00:25:21,989
You.

423
00:25:32,933 --> 00:25:34,835
I would like
to teach you privately

424
00:25:34,935 --> 00:25:37,304
and take no other students.

425
00:25:37,405 --> 00:25:39,106
Uh, thank you so much.

426
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:43,077
What happened?

427
00:25:43,177 --> 00:25:44,111
What happened?

428
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:45,713
Something is very wrong.

429
00:25:45,813 --> 00:25:48,249
I didn't get my way.

430
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:49,750
I need to lie down.

431
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,252
-Yes. Good. -Okay. Get her.
-I need to lie down.

432
00:25:51,352 --> 00:25:52,686
-Get her. Get her. Get her.
-Go, go, go, go. Grab her.

433
00:25:52,787 --> 00:25:53,854
-How?
-We need a pastry.

434
00:25:53,954 --> 00:25:55,456
-Nurse!
-We need a pastry.

435
00:25:55,556 --> 00:25:57,024
Thank you for covering for me.

436
00:25:57,124 --> 00:25:59,627
And I'm humbled
by your munificent offer,

437
00:25:59,727 --> 00:26:01,662
but my father
would never allow it.

438
00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:05,366
Leave your father to me.
I'll speak to him immediately.

439
00:26:05,466 --> 00:26:06,967
So...

440
00:26:07,068 --> 00:26:10,371
how long have you had
this talent?

441
00:26:10,471 --> 00:26:12,106
Talent, uh...

442
00:26:12,206 --> 00:26:14,008
No, uh...

443
00:26:14,108 --> 00:26:16,010
Something just...

444
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:19,313
Something just
takes over me, and...

445
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:21,816
Something I can't control.

446
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:25,252
And when it does,
bad things happen.

447
00:26:30,991 --> 00:26:36,130
If you can learn to use
your powers in the right way.

448
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:40,000

00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,195
Settle down,
ladies and gentlemen.

654
00:39:21,295 --> 00:39:22,462
Settle down.

655
00:39:22,563 --> 00:39:25,398
Quiet. Quiet, everyone.

656
00:39:25,498 --> 00:39:28,736
Now then, I have read
your most recent essays,

657
00:39:28,836 --> 00:39:33,241
and I am amazed to report
some progress.

658
00:39:33,341 --> 00:39:34,542
-Although, some of us...
-Thank you.

659
00:39:34,642 --> 00:39:37,078
...still tend to favor form
over content,

660
00:39:37,178 --> 00:39:39,580
Miss Glinda.

661
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,817
Oh, actually, it's "Ga-linda."

662
00:39:42,917 --> 00:39:44,518
With a "Ga." Mmm.

663
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:46,954
Yes, of course.

664
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:49,290
Glinda.

665
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:50,691
-No, it's...
-Not even close.

666
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:52,560
Um, I don't see
what the problem is.

667
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,861
You know, every other professor

668
00:39:53,961 --> 00:39:56,463
-manages to pronouncify
my name. -Mm-hmm.

669
00:39:56,564 --> 00:39:58,599
Maybe the pronuncification
of your precious name

670
00:39:58,699 --> 00:40:01,736
is not the sole focus
of Dr. Dillamond's life.

671
00:40:01,836 --> 00:40:04,672
Maybe Dr. Dillamond is not like
every other professor.

672
00:40:04,772 --> 00:40:08,209
Maybe some of us
are just different.

673
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:09,810
Well...

674
00:40:09,911 --> 00:40:12,146
it seems the artichoke
is steamed.

675
00:40:13,814 --> 00:40:17,018
The worst way
to cook an artichoke.

676
00:40:17,118 --> 00:40:18,920
Quiet, please. Please.

677
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:23,658
Yes, we goats lack
upper front teeth,

678
00:40:23,758 --> 00:40:25,326
which accounts
for the mispronunciation,

679
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:27,395
Miss Glinda.

680
00:40:29,462 --> 00:40:32,133
You see, indeed,

681
00:40:32,233 --> 00:40:34,635
some of us are different.

682
00:40:35,403 --> 00:40:38,471
Now, you may have noticed
that I am one of

683
00:40:38,572 --> 00:40:40,942
the last animal professors
here at Shiz.

684
00:40:41,042 --> 00:40:44,845
And it isn't encouraged
to discuss this in our classes,

685
00:40:44,946 --> 00:40:48,481
but there have been some
great changes throughout Oz

686
00:40:48,582 --> 00:40:51,451
with the rejection
of animal culture.

687
00:40:52,153 --> 00:40:55,623
However, there was a time,
before you were born,

688
00:40:55,723 --> 00:40:58,426
when life in Oz was different.

689
00:41:00,328 --> 00:41:03,297
When one could walk these halls
and hear a snow leopard

690
00:41:03,397 --> 00:41:05,366
solving an equation

691
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:08,602
or an antelope
explicating a sonnet.

692
00:41:08,703 --> 00:41:13,541
So, when and why
did this change?

693
00:41:13,641 --> 00:41:15,242
Uh, from what I've read,
the Great Drought.

694
00:41:15,343 --> 00:41:17,244
Okay, excuse me.

695
00:41:17,345 --> 00:41:18,279
Like, raise your hand.

696
00:41:18,379 --> 00:41:20,314
Precisely.

697
00:41:20,414 --> 00:41:21,983
Food grew scarce.

698
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:24,852
And when people
are hungry and angry,

699
00:41:24,952 --> 00:41:26,420
well, then they begin
to look for...

700
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,055
Someone to blame.

701
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:31,792
Quite right, Miss Elphaba.

702
00:41:34,562 --> 00:41:38,165
Yes, Miss Glinda?

703
00:41:38,265 --> 00:41:40,134
It is "Ga-linda."

704
00:41:40,234 --> 00:41:42,703
"Ga-linda." "Ga-linda."

705
00:41:42,803 --> 00:41:44,672
And I don't see why
you can't just teach us history

706
00:41:44,772 --> 00:41:47,208
instead of always harping
on the past.

707
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:50,644
Because
we cannot escape the past,

708
00:41:50,745 --> 00:41:53,981
and we ignore it
at our own peril.

709
00:41:54,715 --> 00:41:57,118
The past helps explain
our present circumstances.

710
00:41:57,218 --> 00:42:01,188
For instance,
if we examine this timeline...

711
00:42:16,837 --> 00:42:20,007
Who is responsible for this?

712
00:42:25,514 --> 00:42:30,051
I asked,
who is responsible for this?

713
00:42:34,055 --> 00:42:35,956
Very well.

714
00:42:36,057 --> 00:42:37,258
Class dismissed.

715
00:42:39,493 --> 00:42:41,829
I said, class dismissed.

716
00:42:52,339 --> 00:42:54,308
Dr. Dillamond.

717
00:42:54,408 --> 00:42:56,110
Miss Elphaba.

718
00:42:58,813 --> 00:43:00,915
Miss Elphaba,
you don't have to...

719
00:43:02,483 --> 00:43:03,984
Thank you.

720
00:43:04,085 --> 00:43:05,986
You're very kind.

721
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:14,595
Not bad.

722
00:43:19,467 --> 00:43:21,635
Poppies are my favorite.

723
00:43:21,735 --> 00:43:24,105
Mine, too.

724
00:43:24,205 --> 00:43:27,007
They keep me cheerful
in these dark times.

725
00:43:29,276 --> 00:43:31,245
Miss Elphaba, please.

726
00:43:31,345 --> 00:43:32,680
Go and join your friends.

727
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,282
That's all right.
I don't have any friends.

728
00:43:35,382 --> 00:43:38,619
Well, maybe one.

729
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:55,803
<i>Try again.</i>

730
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:58,639
Eyes shut.

731
00:43:58,739 --> 00:44:01,742
Toes clenched.

732
00:44:02,443 --> 00:44:04,579
Now...

733
00:44:04,678 --> 00:44:07,214
levitate the coin.

734
00:44:45,352 --> 00:44:47,354
It's all right.

735
00:44:47,454 --> 00:44:49,190
It takes time.

736
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:50,724
Hmm?

737
00:44:56,830 --> 00:45:00,834
I hear there was
an unfortunate disturbance

738
00:45:00,935 --> 00:45:03,837
in Dr. Dillamond's class today.

739
00:45:08,008 --> 00:45:10,477
That must have been
so distressful for you.

740
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:12,614
Well...

741
00:45:12,713 --> 00:45:15,449
someone wrote
those horrendible words,

742
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:17,851
on purpose, for him to see.

743
00:45:21,055 --> 00:45:23,224
I just wish I could...

744
00:45:23,324 --> 00:45:24,593
What?

745
00:45:24,693 --> 00:45:26,026
You wish what?

746
00:45:26,126 --> 00:45:28,295
I wish there were something
I could do,

747
00:45:28,395 --> 00:45:29,531
because no one...

748
00:45:31,498 --> 00:45:34,201
No one... Do what?

749
00:45:37,805 --> 00:45:39,608
No one should be scorned

750
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:42,042
or laughed at.

751
00:45:45,479 --> 00:45:47,248
Or looked down upon or...

752
00:45:48,816 --> 00:45:50,552
...told to stop jabbering...

753
00:45:51,686 --> 00:45:53,420
...and keep quiet!

754
00:45:58,993 --> 00:46:00,761
Remarkable.

755
00:46:01,563 --> 00:46:04,098
Absolutely remarkable.

756
00:46:04,999 --> 00:46:08,302
Once you learn
to harness your emotion...

757
00:46:09,504 --> 00:46:10,971
...the sky's the limit.

758
00:46:11,071 --> 00:46:14,408
It could lead you
to the Wizard himself.

759
00:46:22,783 --> 00:46:24,084
Have a good night,
Dr. Dillamond.

760
00:46:24,184 --> 00:46:26,987
Goodbye, Dr. Dillamond.

761
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,094
Dr. Dillamond!

762
00:46:35,396 --> 00:46:36,731
Did you find out who...?

763
00:46:45,507 --> 00:46:48,442
...yet another
incident here at Shiz.

764
00:46:48,543 --> 00:46:53,380
We animals are now being blamed
for everything that goes wrong.

765
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,216
Forced from our jobs,
told to keep silent.

766
00:46:56,317 --> 00:47:00,020
This is much bigger than just
some words on a chalkboard.

767
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:03,190
We can still converse
in private, thank Oz.

768
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:04,992
A dear friend of mine...

769
00:47:05,092 --> 00:47:06,728
-A deer?
-A cow, actually.

770
00:47:06,827 --> 00:47:09,229
She's been speaking out
at protests.

771
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:12,667
Recently wrote me,
asking to meet at a café.

772
00:47:12,767 --> 00:47:14,569
She said it was urgent.

773
00:47:14,669 --> 00:47:16,337
What did she tell you?

774
00:47:16,437 --> 00:47:18,540
She never showed,
and no one's seen her since.

775
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:23,043
Many animals have gone missing
or are actually leaving.

776
00:47:23,143 --> 00:47:25,680
Yesterday, a badger
acquaintance, a solicitor,

777
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:28,717
was sacked,
just for arguing a case.

778
00:47:28,817 --> 00:47:30,384
At least he can still argue.

779
00:47:30,484 --> 00:47:31,586
What do you mean?

780
00:47:31,686 --> 00:47:33,320

I'm leaving Oz

796
00:48:10,157 --> 00:48:11,358
while I can still speak
the word "goodbye."

797
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:12,827
-No, you can't.
-Oh, leave Oz?

798
00:48:16,196 --> 00:48:18,733
Take it away! <i>Stop jabbering.</i>

799
00:48:22,102 --> 00:48:23,170
-Shh. -Oh.

800
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:25,072
-Someone's there.
-What is it?

801
00:48:25,172 --> 00:48:26,508
Miss Elphaba,

802
00:48:26,608 --> 00:48:28,475
what are you doing here?

803
00:48:28,576 --> 00:48:29,910
Well, I was just...

804
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:31,613
-Uh...
-It's all right.

805
00:48:31,713 --> 00:48:33,648
Quickly, come inside.

806
00:48:42,956 --> 00:48:45,325
Don't be frightened.

807
00:48:46,126 --> 00:48:48,195
Let me get you some tea.

808
00:48:48,295 --> 00:48:52,166
Dr. Dillamond, what you were
saying just now...

809
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,669
Could that really happen?

810
00:48:54,769 --> 00:48:56,838
It is happening.

811
00:48:57,605 --> 00:49:00,909
You'll find if you make it
discouraging enough,

812
00:49:01,008 --> 00:49:03,545
you can keep anyone silent.

813
00:49:12,352 --> 00:49:16,023
But if animals are losing the
ability to speak, leaving Oz,

814
00:49:16,123 --> 00:49:18,893
then someone's got to tell
the Wizard.

815
00:49:18,992 --> 00:49:20,695
Listen to me.

816
00:49:20,795 --> 00:49:21,930
You mustn't tell another soul

817
00:49:22,029 --> 00:49:23,631
what you've heard
and seen here tonight.

818
00:49:23,731 --> 00:49:26,066
But that's why we have a Wizard.

819
00:49:26,166 --> 00:49:29,136
♪ So nothing bad ♪

820
00:49:29,236 --> 00:49:30,971
Perhaps you're right.

821
00:49:31,071 --> 00:49:35,643
♪ Nothing all that bad ♪

822
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,879
♪ Nothing truly ♪

823
00:49:37,978 --> 00:49:39,112
♪ Bad... ♪

824
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:44,351
Sorry.

825
00:49:44,451 --> 00:49:45,954
Bad.

826
00:49:46,053 --> 00:49:49,323
I must be catching a cold.

827
00:49:51,726 --> 00:49:54,194
Oz bless you, Dr. Dillamond.

828
00:50:00,568 --> 00:50:01,836
You'd better go.

829
00:50:01,936 --> 00:50:03,403
Take the lamp.

830
00:50:18,252 --> 00:50:19,821
Whoa! Whoa!

831
00:50:19,921 --> 00:50:21,121
Whoa there!

832
00:50:21,221 --> 00:50:22,891
Whoa.

833
00:50:22,991 --> 00:50:24,291
I did not see her.

834
00:50:24,391 --> 00:50:26,995
Yeah, neither did I.

835
00:50:27,094 --> 00:50:28,863
Um, you might want to,

836
00:50:28,963 --> 00:50:30,130
-um, you know.
-Okay.

837
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:31,566
Yeah, leave it with me.

838
00:50:31,666 --> 00:50:33,968
I'm so sorry, miss.
We didn't see you there.

839
00:50:34,067 --> 00:50:36,004
You must've...

840
00:50:36,103 --> 00:50:38,171
blended with the foliage.

841
00:50:38,272 --> 00:50:39,641
Is this how you go through life,

842
00:50:39,741 --> 00:50:42,309
just running amok and
trampling anyone in your path?

843
00:50:42,409 --> 00:50:45,145
No.

844
00:50:45,245 --> 00:50:48,048
No. Sometimes I'm asleep.

845
00:50:51,151 --> 00:50:52,520
All right.

846
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,022
Here we go.

847
00:50:54,121 --> 00:50:55,523
No, I'm not seasick.

848
00:50:55,623 --> 00:50:56,356
Neither am I.

849
00:50:56,456 --> 00:50:58,091
No, I did not eat grass
as a child.

850
00:50:58,191 --> 00:50:59,293
Oh, you didn't? I did.

851
00:50:59,393 --> 00:51:01,763
And, yes,
I have always been green.

852
00:51:01,863 --> 00:51:05,600
And the defensiveness,
is that a recent development?

853
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:10,538
Hmm.

854
00:51:13,041 --> 00:51:15,944
Shh.

855
00:51:16,044 --> 00:51:18,078
Ooh, no, no.

856
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,050
I'm off for some more trampling.

857
00:51:22,149 --> 00:51:23,183
May we offer you a ride?

858
00:51:23,283 --> 00:51:25,653
No, thanks. Get stuffed.

859
00:51:26,688 --> 00:51:28,355
Well.

860
00:51:28,455 --> 00:51:30,925
Feldspur, we have just
been spurned by a girl.

861
00:51:31,025 --> 00:51:32,660
Hmm, indeed.

862
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,762
I guess there's a first time
for everything.

863
00:51:36,564 --> 00:51:38,198
<i>Attention, students.</i>

864
00:51:38,298 --> 00:51:39,834
<i>It is my honor to announce</i>

865
00:51:39,934 --> 00:51:42,369
<i>that Prince Fiyero Tigelaar</i>
<i>of Winkie Country</i>

866
00:51:42,469 --> 00:51:45,039
<i>will be filling out</i>
<i>our student body...</i>

867
00:51:46,841 --> 00:51:49,510
<i>...having transferred</i>
<i>from the Royal Winkie Academy.</i>

868
00:51:51,278 --> 00:51:52,680
<i>Please help him feel welcome</i>

869
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,882
<i>without making</i>
<i>direct eye contact.</i>

870
00:52:09,864 --> 00:52:11,398
Hi.

871
00:52:21,809 --> 00:52:23,645
Enroll here often?

872
00:52:23,745 --> 00:52:25,479
Could I ask you...

873
00:52:26,114 --> 00:52:28,248
Anything. Anything you want.

874
00:52:28,348 --> 00:52:30,051
...just to move out the way?

875
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:32,386
Absolute--
Yeah, that's anything.

876
00:52:33,121 --> 00:52:34,722
-How are you?
-Oh, hi.

877
00:52:34,822 --> 00:52:36,356
Yeah.

878
00:52:48,136 --> 00:52:49,671
Are you looking for something?

879
00:52:49,771 --> 00:52:51,304
Or...

880
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:53,641
...someone?

881
00:52:53,741 --> 00:52:55,442
No, I was...

882
00:52:57,679 --> 00:52:59,446
What was I doing?

883
00:53:00,213 --> 00:53:01,716
How would I know?

884
00:53:01,816 --> 00:53:03,685
Our first fight.

885
00:53:03,785 --> 00:53:05,352
Hmm.

886
00:53:11,391 --> 00:53:13,628
-Oh. Still here.
-Mm-hmm.

887
00:53:14,529 --> 00:53:16,363
Well, I promised
to give a guided tour

888
00:53:16,463 --> 00:53:18,866
to any recently arrived
students, so...

889
00:53:18,966 --> 00:53:20,467
Hmm.

890
00:53:21,201 --> 00:53:22,502
Wait.

891
00:53:22,603 --> 00:53:25,640
Are you
a recently arrived student?

892
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:27,008
I am, yeah.

893
00:53:27,108 --> 00:53:28,643
Oh, I didn't know.

894
00:53:28,743 --> 00:53:31,045
Though I'm not sure
I'll last longer at this school

895
00:53:31,145 --> 00:53:32,980
than any of the others.

896
00:53:33,681 --> 00:53:37,484
But I wasn't at
any of your other schools.

897
00:53:38,152 --> 00:53:39,787
Hmm.

898
00:54:06,848 --> 00:54:11,451
And this is the, um...
the book place.

899
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:13,654
There's a collection of, um,

900
00:54:13,755 --> 00:54:16,057
rare books
around here somewhere,

901
00:54:16,157 --> 00:54:18,492
and some medium rare as well.

902
00:54:18,593 --> 00:54:20,695
Well, there's so many
to choose from.

903
00:54:20,795 --> 00:54:22,429
Right?

904
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:37,979
So what do you do
for fun around here?

905
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,947
Oh, well, nothing.

906
00:54:40,047 --> 00:54:41,348
Until now.

907
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:43,117
You ever been
to the Ozdust Ballroom?

908
00:54:43,217 --> 00:54:44,652
The Ozdust Ballroom?

909
00:54:44,752 --> 00:54:47,287
I mean, isn't that place
somewhat illegal?

910
00:54:47,387 --> 00:54:48,823
And scandalocious?

911
00:54:48,923 --> 00:54:51,491
-Yeah, it is both
of those things. Yeah. -Hmm?

912
00:54:51,592 --> 00:54:54,195
It's also not far from here,
which is another plus.

913
00:54:54,294 --> 00:54:56,264
Whoa.

914
00:54:56,363 --> 00:54:59,432
You all right?

915
00:55:00,168 --> 00:55:01,836
Yeah.

916
00:55:03,237 --> 00:55:04,806
I'm Fiyero Tigelaar.

917
00:55:06,306 --> 00:55:07,675
Winkie Country.

918
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,110
Oh. Oz.

919
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:10,812
Boq Woodsman.

920
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,082
Of Munchkinland.

921
00:55:15,183 --> 00:55:16,717
Great.

922
00:55:16,818 --> 00:55:19,053
Excuse me. Good to know.

923
00:55:19,153 --> 00:55:20,621
Um, what were you saying again

924
00:55:20,721 --> 00:55:24,659
about the Ozdust and fun
and you and me?

925
00:55:24,759 --> 00:55:26,294
Um, unfortunately,
it's against Shiz rules

926
00:55:26,393 --> 00:55:27,895
to go into town after dark.

927
00:55:27,995 --> 00:55:29,630
I see that, once again,
the responsibility to corrupt

928
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:31,232
my fellow students...

929
00:55:31,331 --> 00:55:32,733
...falls to me.

930
00:55:32,834 --> 00:55:33,568
Hmm.

931
00:55:33,668 --> 00:55:35,570
Uh, excuse me.

932
00:55:44,111 --> 00:55:46,080
Whoa.

933
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,682

01:08:20,702 --> 01:08:21,903
Yeah.

1143
01:08:22,003 --> 01:08:24,237
Madame Morrible, you are...

1144
01:08:24,338 --> 01:08:26,608
Seriously, I admire you so...

1145
01:08:26,708 --> 01:08:28,175
Enough.

1146
01:08:30,778 --> 01:08:32,814
A magic wand?

1147
01:08:32,914 --> 01:08:34,048
It's a training wand.

1148
01:08:34,147 --> 01:08:35,583
A training wand?

1149
01:08:35,683 --> 01:08:36,651
For me?

1150
01:08:36,751 --> 01:08:40,320
Madame Morrible, how can I
express my gratitution?

1151
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:43,024
It is my heart's desire
to become a sorceress.

1152
01:08:43,123 --> 01:08:46,293
Thank you
for having faith in me.

1153
01:08:46,393 --> 01:08:49,097
Actually, I have
no faith in you.

1154
01:08:49,196 --> 01:08:53,400
This is your roommate's idea,
not mine.

1155
01:08:54,769 --> 01:08:56,004
I'm confused.

1156
01:08:56,104 --> 01:08:58,106
Miss Elphaba has requested

1157
01:08:58,205 --> 01:09:00,708
that I include you
in our sorcery seminar

1158
01:09:00,808 --> 01:09:03,578
and insisted that I tell you
this very night

1159
01:09:03,678 --> 01:09:05,680
or she would quit.

1160
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:06,681
Elphaba did?

1161
01:09:06,781 --> 01:09:08,382
Mm-hmm.

1162
01:09:08,482 --> 01:09:10,183
But why?

1163
01:09:10,283 --> 01:09:12,120
I'm a sorceress,
not a mind reader.

1164
01:09:12,219 --> 01:09:14,187
I have no idea why.

1165
01:09:14,287 --> 01:09:17,959
But I can't risk losing her,
so here I am.

1166
01:09:19,259 --> 01:09:21,129
My personal opinion, dear,

1167
01:09:21,228 --> 01:09:23,397
is that you do not have
what it takes.

1168
01:09:23,497 --> 01:09:25,833
I hope you prove me wrong.

1169
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,502
I doubt you will.

1170
01:09:29,604 --> 01:09:33,041
Uh, you may want to thank her.
She just got here.

1171
01:09:33,141 --> 01:09:34,642
What?

1172
01:10:14,347 --> 01:10:16,184
What is she wearing?

1173
01:10:20,188 --> 01:10:21,923
What a ridiculous hat.

1174
01:11:11,506 --> 01:11:14,407
Her hat is disgustifying.

1175
01:11:14,509 --> 01:11:16,611
What is she doing?

1176
01:11:16,711 --> 01:11:19,847
Oh, look at her go.

1177
01:11:22,482 --> 01:11:24,118
What does she think
she's doing?

1178
01:11:24,218 --> 01:11:26,220
Is she dancing?

1179
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:32,459
Hi.

1180
01:12:23,077 --> 01:12:27,181
I'll say this much, she doesn't
give a twig what anyone thinks.

1181
01:12:27,281 --> 01:12:28,683
Of course she does.

1182
01:12:30,151 --> 01:12:32,452
She just pretends not to.

1183
01:12:39,026 --> 01:12:41,461
I can't watch.

1184
01:12:43,197 --> 01:12:45,166
I feel awful.

1185
01:12:45,266 --> 01:12:46,634
Why?

1186
01:12:46,734 --> 01:12:48,870
It's not like it's your fault.

1187
01:12:59,013 --> 01:13:00,615
Excuse me.

1188
01:13:52,667 --> 01:13:54,769
-What are you doing?
-Stop.

1189
01:13:58,906 --> 01:14:00,841
No.

1190
01:15:14,548 --> 01:15:16,817
It's all right.

1191
01:15:30,131 --> 01:15:31,899
Hmm.

1192
01:15:42,309 --> 01:15:43,477

Well, do funerals count?

Thank you.

1206
01:16:54,516 --> 01:16:56,016
Ah, I couldn't remotely sleep.

1207
01:16:56,117 --> 01:16:58,252
-Neither can I.
-I know.

1208
01:16:58,352 --> 01:17:01,222
Let's tell each other something
we've never told anyone before.

1209
01:17:01,322 --> 01:17:02,890
Okay, fine. I'll go first.

1210
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:08,262
Fiyero and I
are getting married.

1211
01:17:11,298 --> 01:17:12,466
He asked you already?

1212
01:17:12,567 --> 01:17:14,001
Oh, he doesn't know yet.

1213
01:17:14,101 --> 01:17:15,369
Oh, okay.

1214
01:17:16,804 --> 01:17:18,305
Okay, now you tell me a secret.

1215
01:17:18,405 --> 01:17:19,406
Like what?

1216
01:17:19,508 --> 01:17:21,075
Like...

1217
01:17:22,109 --> 01:17:23,512
Like...

1218
01:17:23,612 --> 01:17:25,112
Why do you sleep

1219
01:17:25,212 --> 01:17:27,047
with this funny little
green bottle under your pillow?

1220
01:17:27,148 --> 01:17:28,849
-What is this? I want to know.
-No, please, give that back.

1221
01:17:28,949 --> 01:17:30,217
-♪ I want to know. ♪
-No, give it back, please.

1222
01:17:30,317 --> 01:17:32,186
-Serious... Oh.
-Give that... Give it back!

1223
01:17:34,822 --> 01:17:37,024
It was my mother's. That's all.

1224
01:17:39,026 --> 01:17:40,928
Well, that's not fair.

1225
01:17:41,028 --> 01:17:43,998
I told you a really good one.

1226
01:18:05,419 --> 01:18:06,621
My father hates me.

1227
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:08,557
What?

1228
01:18:08,657 --> 01:18:10,191
That's not the secret.

1229
01:18:10,291 --> 01:18:11,792
Oh.

1230
01:18:11,892 --> 01:18:14,596
The secret is that, um,

1231
01:18:14,695 --> 01:18:16,697
he has a good reason.

1232
01:18:26,207 --> 01:18:27,908
It's my fault.

1233
01:18:28,577 --> 01:18:30,811
What is?

1234
01:18:33,814 --> 01:18:36,717
That my sister is
the way she is.

1235
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:41,322
When my mother
was carrying Nessa,

1236
01:18:41,422 --> 01:18:44,559
my father began to worry
that she might come out...

1237
01:18:44,659 --> 01:18:46,994
-Green.
-Green.

1238
01:18:48,195 --> 01:18:51,666
He was so worried that he made
my mother chew milkflowers

1239
01:18:51,765 --> 01:18:53,801
day and night.

1240
01:18:55,402 --> 01:18:57,338
Only...

1241
01:18:57,438 --> 01:19:01,141
the milkflowers made
Nessa come too soon, and...

1242
01:19:02,209 --> 01:19:04,878
...and her little legs, they...

1243
01:19:07,649 --> 01:19:09,883
And my mother...

1244
01:19:12,554 --> 01:19:14,288
Well, she never woke up.

1245
01:19:15,356 --> 01:19:18,158
None of which would've ever
happened if it wasn't for...

1246
01:19:20,261 --> 01:19:22,062
...for me.

1247
01:19:23,230 --> 01:19:25,299
So...

1248
01:19:25,399 --> 01:19:27,301
it's my fault.

1249
01:19:28,369 --> 01:19:30,639
What? No.

1250
01:19:30,739 --> 01:19:33,440
That was the milkflowers' fault,

1251
01:19:33,541 --> 01:19:35,309
not yours.

1252
01:19:37,111 --> 01:19:38,647
That might be
your secret, Elphaba,

1253
01:19:38,747 --> 01:19:40,281
but that doesn't make it true.

1254
01:19:44,285 --> 01:19:46,320
Look.

1255
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:48,188
It's tomorrow.

1256
01:19:52,826 --> 01:19:54,028
And, Elphie...

1257
01:19:54,128 --> 01:19:55,630
Can I call you "Elphie"?

1258
01:19:55,730 --> 01:19:58,232
-Well, it's a little bit perky.
I don't really... -I know.

1259
01:19:58,332 --> 01:20:00,467
I know.
I'm gonna call you that.

1260
01:20:01,902 --> 01:20:04,739
And you can call me... Galinda.

1261
01:20:04,838 --> 01:20:06,307
That is your name.

1262
01:20:06,407 --> 01:20:07,341
Let's not quarrel.

1263
01:20:08,442 --> 01:20:10,645
-Elphie?
-Hmm?

1264
01:20:10,745 --> 01:20:12,212
Now that we're friends...

1265
01:20:13,213 --> 01:20:15,717
...I've decided to make you
my new project.

1266
01:20:15,816 --> 01:20:17,451
Oh, you really don't
have to do that.

1267
01:20:17,552 --> 01:20:18,819
I know.

1268

Toss, toss.

Toss, toss.

1351
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:06,581
That's a choice.

1352
01:24:07,447 --> 01:24:11,553
Next, I'm gonna transform
this simple frock/coat...

1353
01:24:11,653 --> 01:24:15,455
this simple "froat"-- boop--
into a magnificent ball gown.

1354
01:24:17,559 --> 01:24:19,059
Ball gown.

1355
01:24:22,764 --> 01:24:24,364
Ball gown.

1356
01:24:25,065 --> 01:24:27,134
Ball gown.

1357
01:24:27,234 --> 01:24:29,737
Come on. I'm counting on you.

1358
01:24:40,314 --> 01:24:43,417
Ball gown.

1359
01:24:43,518 --> 01:24:44,351
Seriously?

1360
01:24:44,451 --> 01:24:46,119
-Do you need my help?
-No!

1361
01:24:46,219 --> 01:24:47,287
Just wear the "froat."
It's pretty.

1362
01:24:50,190 --> 01:24:52,159
Let's just start
a little smaller.

1363
01:24:52,259 --> 01:24:53,962
After you, madame.

1364
01:24:54,062 --> 01:24:56,330
-Thank you.
-Let's see.

1365
01:24:58,666 --> 01:25:00,535
Oh.

1366
01:25:01,569 --> 01:25:02,670
Maybe...

1367
01:25:04,005 --> 01:25:06,239
...just this.

1368
01:25:10,945 --> 01:25:12,212
Pink goes good with green.

1369
01:25:12,312 --> 01:25:14,949
Goes "well" with green.

1370
01:25:15,049 --> 01:25:17,250
It so does.

1371
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:35,135
Why, Miss Elphaba...

1372
01:25:36,938 --> 01:25:38,573
...look at you.

1373
01:25:41,909 --> 01:25:43,711
You're beautiful.

1374
01:25:46,981 --> 01:25:48,683
I have to go.

1375
01:25:48,783 --> 01:25:50,417

1376
01:25:56,924 --> 01:25:58,458
You're welcome.

1377
01:25:59,192 --> 01:26:02,396

-Oh, hey.

1391
01:27:12,166 --> 01:27:13,233
Hey, Elphaba.

1392
01:27:13,333 --> 01:27:15,235
-Hi. How are you?
-Good.

1393

Toss, toss.

1394
01:27:22,844 --> 01:27:24,478
No.

1395
01:27:35,223 --> 01:27:36,724
You've been Galinda-fied.

1396
01:27:41,394 --> 01:27:43,064
You don't need to do that,
you know.

1397
01:27:43,164 --> 01:27:44,799
Hmm.

1398
01:27:46,234 --> 01:27:48,536
Come on. Let's get to class.

1399
01:27:50,071 --> 01:27:51,471
It's Dr. Dilly.

1400
01:27:51,572 --> 01:27:52,807
Or Dr. Dilly, because
you can't call him that.

1401
01:27:52,907 --> 01:27:54,542
-It's Dr. Dillamond.
-Well, he calls me...

1402
01:27:54,642 --> 01:27:55,777
-Hey, it's not his fault.
-He needs to accept it.

1403
01:27:55,877 --> 01:27:57,979
He doesn't have
upper front teeth.

1404
01:27:58,780 --> 01:28:01,115
Uh, Dr. Dillamond,
I picked you some poppies.

1405
01:28:01,215 --> 01:28:03,084
Not now, Miss Elphaba.

1406
01:28:03,184 --> 01:28:06,386
Please, everyone,
take your seats.

1407
01:28:06,486 --> 01:28:08,022
I've something to say

1408
01:28:08,122 --> 01:28:09,624
-and very little time.
-It was upside down, I guess.

1409
01:28:10,457 --> 01:28:12,627
My dear students,

1410
01:28:12,727 --> 01:28:15,362
this will be my last day
here at Shiz.

1411
01:28:15,462 --> 01:28:17,364
You see,

1412
01:28:17,464 --> 01:28:19,667
animals are no longer
permitted to teach.

1413
01:28:19,767 --> 01:28:22,003
-What?
-It's all right, Miss Elphaba.

1414
01:28:22,103 --> 01:28:23,838
I'll be all right. I...

1415
01:28:31,546 --> 01:28:33,981
Students, remain calm, please.

1416
01:28:34,081 --> 01:28:35,482
There's no cause for alarm.

1417
01:28:35,583 --> 01:28:37,185
What is this? What's happening?

1418
01:28:37,285 --> 01:28:38,886
Come on, goat.

1419
01:28:40,688 --> 01:28:41,522
Hey!

1420
01:28:41,622 --> 01:28:43,191
-You can't permit this.
-Miss Elphaba,

1421
01:28:43,291 --> 01:28:44,625
I'm afraid
it's out of our hands.

1422
01:28:44,725 --> 01:28:46,493
They can take away my job,

1423
01:28:46,594 --> 01:28:48,930
-but I shall continue
speaking out! -Dr. Dillamond.

1424
01:28:49,030 --> 01:28:50,565
Listen to me!

1425
01:28:50,665 --> 01:28:52,365
You're not being told
the whole story!

1426
01:28:56,871 --> 01:28:59,774
Are we all just gonna
sit here in silence?

1427
01:29:01,709 --> 01:29:05,947
That's quite enough,
Miss Elphaba.

1428
01:29:07,248 --> 01:29:09,016
Take your seat.

1429
01:29:24,765 --> 01:29:27,235
-Students...
-Are you all right?

1430
01:29:27,335 --> 01:29:28,669
...your new history professor

1431
01:29:28,769 --> 01:29:32,506
has prepared
a special presentation.

1432
01:29:48,388 --> 01:29:50,992
Good afternoon, students.

1433
01:29:53,928 --> 01:29:55,229
Good afternoon!

1434
01:29:55,329 --> 01:29:56,396
Good afternoon.

1435
01:29:56,496 --> 01:29:57,932
In times such as these,

1436
01:29:58,032 --> 01:30:02,970
it behooves us all
not merely to study the past

1437
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:05,973
but to look to the future.

1438
01:30:09,610 --> 01:30:12,780
This is called a cage.

1439
01:30:18,986 --> 01:30:21,856
This remarkable innovation
is for the good of all Oz,

1440
01:30:21,956 --> 01:30:23,591
as well as for
the animal's own good.

1441
01:30:23,691 --> 01:30:25,927
-You see...
-If it's so good,

1442
01:30:26,027 --> 01:30:27,962
why is he trembling?

1443
01:30:31,532 --> 01:30:33,334
He's just happy to be here.

1444
01:30:35,603 --> 01:30:38,039
Now, one benefit of caging
an animal this young

1445
01:30:38,139 --> 01:30:41,208
is that in all likelihood,
he'll never learn to speak.

1446
01:30:41,309 --> 01:30:42,576
Oh, no.

1447
01:30:42,677 --> 01:30:44,278
The dimensions of the cage
will vary

1448
01:30:44,378 --> 01:30:45,546
upon the size of the animal,

1449
01:30:45,646 --> 01:30:47,982
but the basic design
remains the same.

1450
01:30:48,082 --> 01:30:49,650
Let me show you.

1451
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:55,323
Can you imagine a world
where animals are kept in cages

1452
01:30:55,423 --> 01:30:56,757
and they never learn to speak?

1453
01:30:56,857 --> 01:30:58,491
This poor lion cub seems
so frightened.

1454
01:30:58,592 --> 01:31:00,394
What are we gonna do?

1455
01:31:00,493 --> 01:31:01,896
Sorry, "we"?

1456
01:31:01,996 --> 01:31:04,565
Well, someone's got
to do something!

1457
01:31:35,997 --> 01:31:37,298
Hey. Hey, hey.

1458
01:31:37,398 --> 01:31:38,966
Hey, come here.

1459
01:31:41,135 --> 01:31:42,703
What is happening?

1460
01:31:43,371 --> 01:31:45,673
I don't know. I-I got mad and...

1461
01:31:47,608 --> 01:31:49,910
Fiyero, what are you doing?

1462
01:31:51,245 --> 01:31:53,147
Well, you coming?

1463
01:31:53,247 --> 01:31:55,082
Come on.

1464
01:32:00,121 --> 01:32:01,188
Look.

1465
01:32:01,288 --> 01:32:02,890
Come on.

1466
01:32:04,225 --> 01:32:05,760
Come, buddy. That's it.

1467
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:07,595
-There we go. -Yeah.

1468
01:32:07,695 --> 01:32:09,096
-There we go.
-All right.

1469
01:32:33,621 --> 01:32:35,623
What in the name of Oz?

1470
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:14,295
I didn't mean to scare you.

1471
01:33:16,063 --> 01:33:18,833
Why is it you're always
causing some sort of commotion?

1472
01:33:18,933 --> 01:33:21,268
I don't cause commotions--
I am one.

1473
01:33:21,368 --> 01:33:23,003
Yeah. Well, that's for sure.

1474
01:33:23,104 --> 01:33:24,772
So, you think I should
just keep my mouth shut?

1475
01:33:24,872 --> 01:33:26,941
-Is that what you're saying?
-What? No.

1476
01:33:27,041 --> 01:33:28,909
-No, I'm saying... -You think
I want to be this way?

1477
01:33:29,009 --> 01:33:31,011
-I... -You think
I want to care this much?

1478
01:33:31,112 --> 01:33:32,646
-No, I mean...
-I know that my life

1479
01:33:32,746 --> 01:33:34,014
would be much easier
if I didn't care, but...

1480
01:33:34,115 --> 01:33:36,684
Do you ever let
anyone else talk?

1481
01:33:37,985 --> 01:33:39,153
Sorry.

1482
01:33:40,254 --> 01:33:40,955
I was just...

1483
01:33:41,055 --> 01:33:42,957
But can I just say
one more thing?

1484
01:33:44,658 --> 01:33:46,393
You could've walked away
back there.

1485
01:33:46,494 --> 01:33:47,795
So?

1486
01:33:47,895 --> 01:33:50,397
So no matter how shallow
and self-absorbed

1487
01:33:50,498 --> 01:33:51,799
you pretend to be...

1488
01:33:51,899 --> 01:33:53,667
Uh, excuse me.
There is no pretense here.

1489
01:33:53,767 --> 01:33:54,869
I happen to be
genuinely self-absorbed

1490
01:33:54,969 --> 01:33:56,437
-and deeply shallow.
-Oh, please.

1491
01:33:56,538 --> 01:33:57,805
No, you're not.

1492
01:33:57,905 --> 01:33:59,874
Otherwise, you wouldn't be
so unhappy.

1493
01:34:09,216 --> 01:34:10,751
Fine.

1494
01:34:12,019 --> 01:34:13,888
Well, if you don't
want my help...

1495
01:34:13,988 --> 01:34:15,289
No, I do.

1496
01:35:02,703 --> 01:35:05,072
What did you mean to do
back there?

1497
01:35:06,874 --> 01:35:09,777
And why was I the only one
you didn't do it to?

1498
01:35:16,217 --> 01:35:17,284
You're bleeding.

1499
01:35:18,452 --> 01:35:19,486
Am I?

1500
01:35:19,588 --> 01:35:21,722
Mm-hmm.

1501
01:35:35,336 --> 01:35:36,870
There.

1502
01:35:41,543 --> 01:35:43,377
It must've scratched you.

1503
01:35:43,477 --> 01:35:45,279
Yeah.

1504
01:35:47,281 --> 01:35:50,150
Or maybe it scratched me
or something.

1505
01:35:53,020 --> 01:35:54,788
I better get to safety.

1506
01:35:55,523 --> 01:35:57,057
-The cub.
-Mm-hmm.

1507
01:35:57,157 --> 01:35:58,727
-I better get the, uh...
-Of course.

1508
01:35:58,826 --> 01:35:59,793
...the cub to safety.

1509
01:35:59,893 --> 01:36:02,029
Mm-hmm.

1510
01:36:07,167 --> 01:36:08,836

<i>Miss Elphaba!</i>

1546
01:39:40,113 --> 01:39:41,850
<i>Come at once!</i>

1547
01:39:48,489 --> 01:39:49,724
There!

1548
01:39:51,258 --> 01:39:53,360
Elph... Elphie,
you got to get down there.

1549
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:54,963
Come on.

1550
01:39:58,833 --> 01:40:00,000
Miss Elphaba,

1551
01:40:00,100 --> 01:40:01,636
I finally heard back
from the Wizard.

1552
01:40:01,736 --> 01:40:03,538
Look!

1553
01:40:11,178 --> 01:40:13,681
Oh, stop.

1554
01:40:13,781 --> 01:40:16,718
I just cannot.

1555
01:40:28,095 --> 01:40:30,063
It's yours. Open it.

1556
01:40:35,937 --> 01:40:38,238
"His Royal Ozness,

1557
01:40:38,338 --> 01:40:39,841
the Wonderful Wizard of Oz..."

1558
01:40:41,308 --> 01:40:42,644
"...summons you
most ceremony-ishly

1559
01:40:42,744 --> 01:40:46,046
to his personal palace
in the Emerald City."

1560
01:40:46,146 --> 01:40:48,315
Uh, wait. Um, wait.

1561
01:40:48,415 --> 01:40:50,752
"This invitation
is nontransferable."

1562
01:41:00,028 --> 01:41:02,062
-Bye.
-Bye.

1563
01:41:02,162 --> 01:41:05,432
This is your chance
to make good.

1564
01:41:06,433 --> 01:41:09,503
Of course, you're going to
have to prove yourself first.

1565
01:41:09,604 --> 01:41:12,674
-Prove myself?
-Prove yourself worthy.

1566
01:41:12,774 --> 01:41:14,174
Deary...

1567
01:41:14,274 --> 01:41:16,243
this is the Wizard of Oz.

1568
01:41:16,343 --> 01:41:19,047
If he's gonna grant
your heart's desire...

1569
01:41:19,146 --> 01:41:20,648
But prove myself how?

1570
01:41:20,748 --> 01:41:22,082
I...

1571
01:41:22,182 --> 01:41:24,052
I'm not ready. It's too soon.

1572
01:41:24,151 --> 01:41:25,653
Don't be so pessi-mystical.

1573
01:41:25,753 --> 01:41:29,057
I, too, had to prove my powers
when I met the Wizard.

1574
01:41:29,156 --> 01:41:30,992
You'll find a way.

1575
01:41:31,091 --> 01:41:32,627
I have faith in you.

1576
01:41:36,864 --> 01:41:38,800
Not to fret.

1577
01:41:38,900 --> 01:41:40,835
Weather is my specialty.

1578
01:41:43,838 --> 01:41:45,172
Mustn't let you get wet.

1579
01:41:45,272 --> 01:41:47,675
Okay. I'll make a hand umbrella.

1580
01:41:47,775 --> 01:41:49,711
My hair. Thank you.

1581
01:41:57,652 --> 01:42:00,655
Not when you're on the cusp
of greatness.

1582
01:42:31,519 --> 01:42:35,623
All aboard for the Emerald City!

1583
01:42:35,723 --> 01:42:38,626
Father, this is Boq,
the boy I wrote to you about.

1584
01:42:38,726 --> 01:42:40,094
Oh, yes.

1585
01:42:40,193 --> 01:42:43,097
Governor Thropp,
good to meet you.

1586
01:42:43,230 --> 01:42:44,599
Oh, I've heard
so much about you.

1587
01:42:44,699 --> 01:42:48,069
My Nessarose is
very precious to me,

1588
01:42:48,168 --> 01:42:51,304
so you see you take
good care of her.

1589
01:42:52,807 --> 01:42:54,441
I-I understand.

1590
01:42:55,143 --> 01:42:56,511
Good.

1591
01:42:58,079 --> 01:42:59,312
Elphie.

1592
01:42:59,413 --> 01:43:00,948
Elphie, the train is here.

1593
01:43:01,049 --> 01:43:02,449
And it came with the cutest
little man with a mustache.

1594
01:43:02,550 --> 01:43:04,484
You got to see him.

1595
01:43:04,585 --> 01:43:06,921
Oh, Elphie,
how will we manage without you?

1596
01:43:07,021 --> 01:43:08,756
You won't even notice I'm gone.

1597
01:43:08,856 --> 01:43:09,824
Uh, you have Fiyero.

1598
01:43:09,924 --> 01:43:11,224
Oh.

1599
01:43:11,324 --> 01:43:12,827
Um, speaking of Fiyero,
uh, where is he?

1600
01:43:12,927 --> 01:43:14,461
Not that I expected him
to come and say goodbye, but...

1601
01:43:14,562 --> 01:43:17,165
I mean, we barely
know each other.

1602
01:43:17,264 --> 01:43:19,167
Well, I barely know him
anymore either.

1603
01:43:19,266 --> 01:43:21,334
He's been different.

1604
01:43:21,936 --> 01:43:24,438
He's distant and moodified.

1605
01:43:25,505 --> 01:43:29,644
And he's been thinking,
which really worries me.

1606
01:43:29,744 --> 01:43:32,513
It all started the day
Dr. Dillamond was fired.

1607
01:43:32,613 --> 01:43:35,215
I mean, who knew he cared
so much about that old goat?

1608
01:43:35,315 --> 01:43:37,752
Look, he did come.

1609
01:43:37,852 --> 01:43:39,120
Dearest.

1610
01:43:39,219 --> 01:43:40,888
We're over here, darling.

1611
01:43:40,988 --> 01:43:42,456
Come.

1612
01:43:42,557 --> 01:43:43,925
Hi.

1613
01:43:45,126 --> 01:43:46,493
Elphaba.

1614
01:43:46,594 --> 01:43:48,261
Fiyero.

1615
01:43:49,030 --> 01:43:51,632
I'm happy for you.

1616
01:43:51,733 --> 01:43:52,934
Thank you.

1617
01:43:53,034 --> 01:43:55,803
Yes. We are both so happy.

1618
01:43:55,903 --> 01:43:56,904
I've been thinking...

1619
01:43:57,004 --> 01:43:59,306
Yeah, I heard.

1620
01:43:59,406 --> 01:44:02,643
...about the, uh,
the lion cub and Dr. Dillamond.

1621
01:44:04,078 --> 01:44:05,780
I think about that day a lot.

1622
01:44:06,848 --> 01:44:08,415
So do I.

1623
01:44:14,889 --> 01:44:16,023
Oh, me, too.

1624
01:44:16,124 --> 01:44:17,992
Oh, me, too. Me, too.

1625
01:44:18,092 --> 01:44:19,227
Mm-hmm.

1626
01:44:19,326 --> 01:44:21,229
I think about it constantly.

1627
01:44:21,328 --> 01:44:23,965
I mean, poor Dr. Dillamond.

1628
01:44:24,065 --> 01:44:26,333
It makes one want to...

1629
01:44:27,935 --> 01:44:29,469
...to take a stand.

1630
01:44:30,938 --> 01:44:32,974
In fact, excuse me.

1631
01:44:33,074 --> 01:44:34,842
Everyone. Please.

1632
01:44:34,942 --> 01:44:37,111
I have an announcement.

1633
01:44:40,948 --> 01:44:43,184
I am changing my name.

1634
01:44:43,283 --> 01:44:45,418
-What? -What?

1635
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:47,622
-Your name?
-Yes.

1636
01:44:47,722 --> 01:44:49,624
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

1637
01:44:49,724 --> 01:44:52,392
Since Dr. Dillamond used to
have his own goat-like way

1638
01:44:52,492 --> 01:44:54,695
of pronouncifying my name,

1639
01:44:54,796 --> 01:44:55,730
in solidarity

1640
01:44:55,830 --> 01:44:59,499
and in order to express
my outrage,

1641
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:04,772
I will henceforward be known
no longer as "Ga-linda"

1642
01:45:04,872 --> 01:45:06,574
but simply...

1643
01:45:08,943 --> 01:45:10,343
...Glinda.

1644
01:45:10,443 --> 01:45:12,547
Clapping.

1645
01:45:12,647 --> 01:45:14,916
-She's so good.
-Oh, she so is.

1646
01:45:15,016 --> 01:45:16,751
Such braverism.

1647
01:45:16,851 --> 01:45:19,452
Oh!

1648
01:45:22,422 --> 01:45:25,458
Galinda no more.
Glinda henceforth.

1649
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:27,295
Glinda, you're wonderful!

1650
01:45:29,697 --> 01:45:31,431
Glinda!

1651
01:45:44,312 --> 01:45:46,479
Good luck.

1652
01:45:53,221 --> 01:45:54,922
See?

1653
01:45:55,022 --> 01:45:57,525
There. Wh-Wh-What is that?

1654
01:45:57,625 --> 01:45:59,660
-Don't be upset, Galinda.
-It's "Glinda" now!

1655
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:01,662
Stupid. I don't even know
what made me say it.

1656
01:46:01,762 --> 01:46:02,930
It doesn't even matter
what your name is.

1657
01:46:03,030 --> 01:46:03,965
Everyone loves you.

1658
01:46:04,065 --> 01:46:05,299
I don't care.

1659
01:46:05,398 --> 01:46:07,535
I want him.

1660
01:46:07,635 --> 01:46:09,070
I don't even think
he's perfect anymore,

1661
01:46:09,170 --> 01:46:10,437
and I still want him.

1662
01:46:10,538 --> 01:46:14,208
This must be
what other people feel like.

1663
01:46:14,308 --> 01:46:15,810
How do they bear it?

1664
01:46:16,777 --> 01:46:19,412
All aboard for the Emerald City!

1665
01:46:19,513 --> 01:46:21,515
The mustache man.

1666
01:46:21,616 --> 01:46:24,085
Hey, come on. The train.

1667
01:46:27,321 --> 01:46:28,956
Thank you.

1668
01:46:49,543 --> 01:46:52,380
Stand clear of the doors!

1669
01:46:52,479 --> 01:46:55,082
Goodbye!

1670
01:46:57,450 --> 01:46:59,520
Oh. Wait.

1671
01:46:59,620 --> 01:47:01,756
Oh, excuse me. Um...

1672
01:47:01,856 --> 01:47:04,659
Elphie, here.
I forgot to give you this.

1673
01:47:04,759 --> 01:47:05,993
Oh.

1674
01:47:06,093 --> 01:47:07,862
Bye.

1675
01:47:16,203 --> 01:47:17,672
Come with me!

1676
01:47:17,772 --> 01:47:18,406
What?

1677
01:47:18,505 --> 01:47:19,540
To meet the Wizard.

1678
01:47:19,640 --> 01:47:20,808
What are you saying?

1679
01:47:20,908 --> 01:47:23,277
Get on the train.
You're gonna miss it.

1680
01:47:23,377 --> 01:47:24,779
I wouldn't want to impose.

1681
01:47:24,879 --> 01:47:26,414
It doesn't-- It doesn't matter.
Just come with me.

1682
01:47:26,514 --> 01:47:27,882
I couldn't possibly.
This is your moment.

1683
01:47:27,982 --> 01:47:28,883

Hello.

1794
01:55:16,150 --> 01:55:17,719
Elphaba Thropp.

1795
01:55:17,819 --> 01:55:19,854
Listen to me.

1796
01:55:19,953 --> 01:55:22,489
You can do this.

1797
01:55:22,590 --> 01:55:25,492
You can do anything.

1798
01:56:03,063 --> 01:56:04,866
-What is that sound?
-I don't know.

1799
01:56:06,935 --> 01:56:08,235
-Oh, no. I do not...
-No, go.

1800
01:56:08,335 --> 01:56:09,403
-I cannot go.
-Go, go, go.

1801
01:56:09,503 --> 01:56:11,739
-Go. Elphaba. Go.
-I don't... Oh.

1802
01:56:16,210 --> 01:56:20,247
I am Oz.

1803
01:56:20,347 --> 01:56:22,249
Oh, Elphie.

1804
01:56:22,349 --> 01:56:25,920
I am Oz, the Great and Terrible.

1805
01:56:27,221 --> 01:56:29,557
Who are you?

1806
01:56:29,657 --> 01:56:33,962
And why do you seek me?

1807
01:56:34,061 --> 01:56:36,497
Elphie, say something.
Say something.

1808
01:56:36,598 --> 01:56:38,031
-What am I supposed to say?
-Just say something. Anything.

1809
01:56:38,131 --> 01:56:40,133
-Say something.
-Um...

1810
01:56:40,234 --> 01:56:43,605
Say something!

1811
01:56:44,772 --> 01:56:45,874
My name is Elphaba Thropp...

1812
01:56:45,974 --> 01:56:47,942
...Your Ozness.

1813
01:56:48,041 --> 01:56:49,476
And-and this is...

1814
01:56:49,577 --> 01:56:51,546
E-Elphaba, is that you?

1815
01:56:55,282 --> 01:56:56,618
Elphaba Thropp?

1816
01:56:56,718 --> 01:56:58,018
A man.

1817
01:56:58,118 --> 01:56:59,787
Elphaba Thropp.

1818
01:56:59,888 --> 01:57:01,421
I didn't know it was you.

1819
01:57:01,523 --> 01:57:03,257
You made it.

1820
01:57:04,124 --> 01:57:05,727
Uh, sorry about all that.

1821
01:57:05,827 --> 01:57:07,829
I didn't mean to...

1822
01:57:07,929 --> 01:57:09,496
startle you.

1823
01:57:10,865 --> 01:57:12,032
You know, when I'm back there,

1824
01:57:12,132 --> 01:57:14,434
I cannot make out
people's faces.

1825
01:57:15,235 --> 01:57:17,705
Well, it's just so...

1826
01:57:17,805 --> 01:57:19,206
It's so great to meet you...

1827
01:57:22,777 --> 01:57:23,912
It's so great to...

1828
01:57:24,012 --> 01:57:25,145
-Hang on. What's that?
-What?

1829
01:57:25,245 --> 01:57:26,581
I'm so sorry. May I?

1830
01:57:26,681 --> 01:57:29,182
-S-Sure. Yes.
-Okay, now, just... It's okay.

1831
01:57:29,918 --> 01:57:31,586
Oh.

1832
01:57:31,686 --> 01:57:33,487
For you.

1833
01:57:33,588 --> 01:57:34,454
My special guest.

1834
01:57:34,556 --> 01:57:36,189
That's a keepsake
for you to cherish

1835
01:57:36,290 --> 01:57:38,726
for all of your days.

1836
01:57:38,826 --> 01:57:40,862
Very kind of you, Your Ozness.

1837
01:57:40,962 --> 01:57:42,229
Thank you.

1838
01:57:42,329 --> 01:57:46,166
And this is, uh,
an additional unexpected--

1839
01:57:46,266 --> 01:57:48,435
Hi. What's your name?

1840
01:57:48,536 --> 01:57:50,137
Glinda.

1841
01:57:50,872 --> 01:57:52,006
The "Ga" is silent.

1842
01:57:52,105 --> 01:57:54,207
Hello, Belinda.

1843
01:57:54,308 --> 01:57:56,476
Uh, what you looking at there?

1844
01:57:56,578 --> 01:57:58,111
Oh, yeah. Ugh.

1845
01:57:58,211 --> 01:57:59,647
Well, I don't know.

1846
01:57:59,747 --> 01:58:01,281
I think it's a bit much,

1847
01:58:01,381 --> 01:58:04,084
but, uh, folks have come
to expect that sort of thing.

1848
01:58:04,184 --> 01:58:05,853
♪ And you gotta
give the people ♪

1849
01:58:07,287 --> 01:58:09,389
♪ What they want. ♪

1850
01:58:09,489 --> 01:58:10,992
That's good.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1851
01:58:11,091 --> 01:58:13,995
But if you think
that's something to see,

1852
01:58:14,094 --> 01:58:15,830
wait till you see this.

1853
01:58:15,930 --> 01:58:19,934
I give you the Oz of tomorrow.

1854
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:28,943
Yes. Yes.

1855
01:58:29,744 --> 01:58:31,946
Now, I don't know if your eyes
have already fallen upon

1856
01:58:32,046 --> 01:58:33,480
this long and winding path.

1857
01:58:33,581 --> 01:58:35,482
-Do you see that?
-Mm-hmm.

1858
01:58:35,583 --> 01:58:37,351
-I think people
need direction. -Mmm.

1859
01:58:37,451 --> 01:58:39,621
When this thing
gets built, everybody, always,

1860
01:58:39,721 --> 01:58:42,890
is gonna remember that
if you just follow the road--

1861
01:58:42,991 --> 01:58:45,093
follow the road--

1862
01:58:45,192 --> 01:58:47,095
it's gonna lead you right...

1863
01:58:47,194 --> 01:58:48,563
to me.

1864
01:58:48,663 --> 01:58:50,397
Recently, I've gotten
a little stuck

1865
01:58:50,497 --> 01:58:52,033
trying to figure out what color

1866
01:58:52,132 --> 01:58:53,534
the bricks of that road
ought to be.

1867
01:58:53,635 --> 01:58:55,168
So, I jerry-rigged
this thing up,

1868
01:58:55,268 --> 01:58:57,839
which does that.

1869
01:58:57,939 --> 01:58:59,139
Oh.

1870
01:58:59,239 --> 01:59:01,509
Uh, Elphaba,
you give that a whirl.

1871
01:59:01,609 --> 01:59:02,376
Oh, sure.

1872
01:59:02,476 --> 01:59:04,545
Um, let's try.

1873
01:59:06,114 --> 01:59:07,849
What about green?

1874
01:59:07,949 --> 01:59:09,249
Hmm.

1875
01:59:09,349 --> 01:59:12,219
Um, yellow.

1876
01:59:12,319 --> 01:59:14,822
Maybe purple?

1877
01:59:14,922 --> 01:59:16,323
Wait.

1878
01:59:16,423 --> 01:59:18,026
Just go back one, please.

1879
01:59:18,126 --> 01:59:19,694
The yellow, really?

1880
01:59:19,794 --> 01:59:21,129
-Yes.
-Huh.

1881
01:59:21,228 --> 01:59:22,764
It just says "road" to me.

1882
01:59:22,864 --> 01:59:24,699
Let me see. Huh.

1883
01:59:24,799 --> 01:59:26,701
And... Oh.

1884
01:59:26,801 --> 01:59:28,002
Yellow brick road?

1885
01:59:28,102 --> 01:59:29,904
I don't know.

1886
01:59:30,004 --> 01:59:31,238
Oh, hey.

1887
01:59:31,338 --> 01:59:32,439
-Come up here.
-Oh.

1888
01:59:32,540 --> 01:59:35,843
Come up here with me
in my sandbox.

1889
01:59:35,943 --> 01:59:37,011
Step right up. Watch this.

1890
01:59:37,111 --> 01:59:38,445
So here's where we are,

1891
01:59:38,546 --> 01:59:42,182
and when we open it up,
inside...

1892
01:59:42,282 --> 01:59:44,852
-That's you.
-Well, it is me.

1893
01:59:44,952 --> 01:59:46,286
Yeah, it is me.

1894
01:59:46,386 --> 01:59:48,089
I like it. I shouldn't.

1895
01:59:48,188 --> 01:59:50,024
I'm here by myself a lot.
Anyway.

1896
01:59:50,124 --> 01:59:52,026
I don't, uh... Oh.

1897
01:59:52,126 --> 01:59:53,493
I forgot.

1898
01:59:53,594 --> 01:59:55,630
If my head wasn't attached,
it would, uh...

1899
01:59:55,730 --> 01:59:58,800
I'd-I'd leave it
in, uh, Munchkinland.

1900
01:59:58,900 --> 02:00:01,836
Hey, you know what I had made?
Look. Special.

1901
02:00:04,839 --> 02:00:06,040
Keep that.

1902
02:00:06,140 --> 02:00:07,809
I... No, I mean it.

1903
02:00:07,909 --> 02:00:09,077
Keep it, keep it forever.

1904
02:00:09,177 --> 02:00:11,546
Because at some point,
who knows?

1905
02:00:11,646 --> 02:00:14,916
We might be putting
your little artifact in there

1906
02:00:15,016 --> 02:00:16,617
right next to mine.

1907
02:00:16,718 --> 02:00:18,619
'Cause maybe someday,
you're gonna be calling

1908
02:00:18,720 --> 02:00:22,623
this whole pile of stones
your home.

1909
02:00:25,492 --> 02:00:27,494
Elphie.

1910
02:00:28,763 --> 02:00:30,497
She's green.

1911
02:00:30,598 --> 02:00:34,267
Oh, well,
she doesn't have to be.

1912
02:00:34,367 --> 02:00:37,572
Would that be your...
your heart's desire?

1913
02:00:47,582 --> 02:00:48,750
No.

1914
02:00:51,586 --> 02:00:53,286
No.

1915
02:00:54,989 --> 02:00:57,892
My heart's desire is for you
to help the animals.

1916
02:00:57,992 --> 02:01:01,428
Something bad is happening
to them, and they need you.

1917
02:01:01,529 --> 02:01:03,931
I had a feeling
you were gonna say that.

1918
02:01:04,031 --> 02:01:05,733
And I agree wholeheartedly.

1919
02:01:05,833 --> 02:01:08,703
Yeah. Wow,
that's the darndest thing.

1920
02:01:08,803 --> 02:01:12,073
It's almost like I, uh...
I already know you.

1921
02:01:13,473 --> 02:01:15,743
I knew you'd understand.

1922
02:01:15,843 --> 02:01:18,345
That makes me...
That makes me so happy.

1923
02:01:18,445 --> 02:01:21,249
Well, that's what I love best.

1924
02:01:21,348 --> 02:01:23,050

1946
02:03:14,896 --> 02:03:17,798
Madame Morrible,
what are you doing here?

1947
02:03:17,899 --> 02:03:21,269
Oh, deary.

1948
02:03:21,369 --> 02:03:23,271
I couldn't miss your big moment.

1949
02:03:28,776 --> 02:03:31,178
Neither could you, I see. Hmm.

1950
02:03:31,279 --> 02:03:33,014
I...

1951
02:03:43,090 --> 02:03:44,692
I don't believe it.

1952
02:03:45,458 --> 02:03:47,128
Is that the Grimmerie?

1953
02:03:47,228 --> 02:03:48,696
Yes.

1954
02:03:49,931 --> 02:03:52,300
That's the ancient book
of wisdom,

1955
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:55,002
thaumaturgy and enchantments.

1956
02:04:06,714 --> 02:04:08,749
Can I touch it?

1957
02:04:09,850 --> 02:04:11,052
No.

1958
02:04:12,186 --> 02:04:14,322
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1959
02:04:14,422 --> 02:04:15,890
She may not be ready.

1960
02:04:15,990 --> 02:04:19,060
Casting a spell
with the Grimmerie,

1961
02:04:19,160 --> 02:04:21,162
that's a mighty tall order.

1962
02:04:21,262 --> 02:04:22,730
I, you know, I should know.

1963
02:04:22,830 --> 02:04:24,765
You're right.
We mustn't rush her.

1964
02:04:24,865 --> 02:04:27,001
Perhaps today has been
too overwhelming.

1965
02:04:27,101 --> 02:04:29,670
No. Please.

1966
02:04:30,371 --> 02:04:32,573
Let me try.

1967
02:04:32,673 --> 02:04:34,308
Let me prove myself.

1968
02:04:34,408 --> 02:04:36,610
Well...

1969
02:04:58,899 --> 02:05:01,302
Sweet Oz.

1970
02:05:01,402 --> 02:05:03,604
It opened for her.

1971
02:05:16,817 --> 02:05:19,387
So, which spell
are you gonna start with?

1972
02:05:19,487 --> 02:05:22,123
We've been working
on levitation.

1973
02:05:22,223 --> 02:05:23,624
Levitation?

1974
02:05:23,724 --> 02:05:25,760
Oh. That's interesting.

1975
02:05:25,860 --> 02:05:29,864
Do you know that, um,
Chistery here...

1976
02:05:29,964 --> 02:05:33,000
Ha-Have you ladies met,
uh, Ch-Chistery,

1977
02:05:33,100 --> 02:05:36,170
the leader of my...
my Emerald Guards?

1978
02:05:36,270 --> 02:05:37,838
Pleased to meet you.

1979
02:05:37,938 --> 02:05:39,707
Uh, he'd hate to admit this--

1980
02:05:39,807 --> 02:05:41,442
does not like
talking about himself--

1981
02:05:41,542 --> 02:05:44,145
but he watches birds

1982
02:05:44,245 --> 02:05:48,682
so longingly every morning.

1983
02:05:48,783 --> 02:05:50,217
Birds?

1984
02:05:51,719 --> 02:05:52,820
How can I help him?

1985
02:05:52,920 --> 02:05:54,688
-I-I don't...
-Elphie, look.

1986
02:06:01,495 --> 02:06:03,697
Are those words?

1987
02:06:05,766 --> 02:06:07,768
The lost language.

1988
02:06:07,868 --> 02:06:10,738
Our lost language of spells.

1989
02:06:10,838 --> 02:06:12,740
Don't be discouraged

1990
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:14,742
if you can't decipher it.

1991
02:06:14,842 --> 02:06:19,346
Deary, I, myself,
can only read a word or two,

1992
02:06:19,447 --> 02:06:21,248
and that took years.

1993
02:06:21,348 --> 02:06:23,017
"Ah ben tah kay.

1994
02:06:23,117 --> 02:06:25,586
"Ah ben tah kay ah.

1995
02:06:25,686 --> 02:06:27,321
-"An tay deh tum.
-Oh, Elphie.

1996
02:06:27,421 --> 02:06:28,956
-"En-tay ah.
-Praise Oz.

1997
02:06:29,590 --> 02:06:31,058
"Ah ben tah kay ah.

1998
02:06:31,158 --> 02:06:32,860
"En-tay ah. Tin feh tah.

1999
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:35,429
"Ah ben kanaph. Ah ben janah.

2000
02:06:35,530 --> 02:06:37,566
"Ah ben vinge. Ah ben ala.

2001
02:06:37,665 --> 02:06:39,033
"Ah ben krahu. Ah ben kanat.

2002
02:06:39,133 --> 02:06:41,302
"Ah ben nku. Ah ben kanaph.

2003
02:06:41,402 --> 02:06:42,703
"Ah ben janah. Ah ben vinge.

2004
02:06:42,803 --> 02:06:45,039
"Ah ben ala. Ah ben krahu.

2005
02:06:45,139 --> 02:06:47,775
"A ben kanat. Ah ben nku.
Ah ben kanaph.

2006
02:06:47,875 --> 02:06:49,844
-Ah ben janah. Ah ben vinge."
-What did I tell you?

2007
02:06:49,944 --> 02:06:51,513
"Ah ben ala. Ah ben krahu.

2008
02:06:51,612 --> 02:06:53,481
"A ben kanat. Ah ben nku.

2009
02:06:53,582 --> 02:06:55,449
"Ah ben kanaph. Ah ben janah.

2010
02:06:55,550 --> 02:06:56,750
"Ah ben vinge. Ah ben ava.

2011
02:06:56,851 --> 02:06:59,588
"Ah ben ah krahu. A ben kanat.

2012
02:06:59,687 --> 02:07:01,789
Ah ben nku. Ah ben ka..."

2013
02:07:03,558 --> 02:07:05,359
Chistery, are you all right?

2014
02:07:05,459 --> 02:07:07,228
Chistery?

2015
02:07:10,798 --> 02:07:12,333
It's just the transition, deary.

2016
02:07:12,433 --> 02:07:14,168
It's just the transition.

2017
02:07:23,711 --> 02:07:25,646
Oh.

2018
02:07:29,450 --> 02:07:30,619
But it's hurting him.

2019
02:07:30,718 --> 02:07:32,653
Chistery.

2020
02:07:32,753 --> 02:07:34,755
Don't bite. Don't bite.

2021
02:08:04,586 --> 02:08:06,086
Glory-osky.

2022
02:08:06,187 --> 02:08:07,254
You did it.

2023
02:08:07,354 --> 02:08:09,190
You actually did it.

2024
02:08:19,601 --> 02:08:21,435
He's in pain.

2025
02:08:21,536 --> 02:08:22,836
Quick. How do I reverse it?

2026
02:08:22,937 --> 02:08:24,939
-Reverse it?
-How do I reverse it?!

2027
02:08:25,039 --> 02:08:27,975
A spell from the Grimmerie
can never be reversed.

2028
02:08:32,012 --> 02:08:33,648
Elphaba.

2029
02:08:33,747 --> 02:08:36,016
-Elphaba.
-No. No.

2030
02:08:53,602 --> 02:08:55,402
I knew she had the power.

2031
02:08:55,502 --> 02:08:56,737
I told you.

2032
02:08:56,837 --> 02:08:58,339
Elphie, this is astoundifying.

2033
02:08:58,439 --> 02:09:00,741
It's just what we hoped for--
eyes in the skies.

2034
02:09:00,841 --> 02:09:04,078
Yes. They'll make perfect spies.

2035
02:09:04,178 --> 02:09:05,779
Spies?

2036
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:08,949
-Elphaba? Elphaba?
-Oh, uh, no. No.

2037
02:09:09,049 --> 02:09:11,452
Elphie? Elphie?

2038
02:09:13,787 --> 02:09:14,888
You're right.
That's a very harsh word.

2039
02:09:14,989 --> 02:09:16,257
Oh, "scouts."
What about "scouts"?

2040
02:09:16,357 --> 02:09:18,092
'Cause they're gonna be
flying around Oz

2041
02:09:18,192 --> 02:09:19,827
reporting back on any
seditious animal activity...

2042
02:09:19,927 --> 02:09:21,696
Seditious animal activity?
What does that mean?

2043
02:09:21,795 --> 02:09:23,063
-Elphie.
-What are you s...

2044
02:09:23,163 --> 02:09:25,032
I'm sure the Wizard
has a good reason.

2045
02:09:29,503 --> 02:09:31,038
It's you.

2046
02:09:31,839 --> 02:09:33,440
You're behind all of this.

2047
02:09:34,308 --> 02:09:36,176
You're the reason
why people are turning

2048
02:09:36,277 --> 02:09:38,912
against the animals. You...
It's all because of you.

2049
02:09:40,047 --> 02:09:42,416
We're doing this
to keep people safe.

2050
02:09:42,517 --> 02:09:43,884
All of Oz will benefit.

2051
02:09:43,984 --> 02:09:45,986
And you've known all along.

2052
02:09:47,488 --> 02:09:48,789
Since the day you met me.

2053
02:09:48,889 --> 02:09:51,925
You will benefit, too, deary.

2054
02:09:52,026 --> 02:09:53,628
-You must trust me.
-Don't.

2055
02:09:53,728 --> 02:09:55,796
-Don't!
-El-Elphaba.

2056
02:09:55,896 --> 02:09:59,500
When I first got here,
well, there was discord.

2057
02:09:59,601 --> 02:10:00,868
There was discontent.

2058
02:10:00,968 --> 02:10:03,871
And back where I come from,
everybody knows

2059
02:10:03,971 --> 02:10:07,709
that the best way
to bring folks together

2060
02:10:07,808 --> 02:10:11,513
is to give them a...
a real good enemy.

2061
02:10:12,279 --> 02:10:14,381
If you wanted s-spies,
why wouldn't you just...

2062
02:10:14,481 --> 02:10:16,417
Why wouldn't you just
make them yourself?

2063
02:10:16,518 --> 02:10:18,085
You...

2064
02:10:25,794 --> 02:10:27,328
Elphaba.

2065
02:10:28,362 --> 02:10:29,863
Elphaba.

2066
02:10:29,963 --> 02:10:32,366
You are talking
to the Wizard of Oz!

2067
02:10:34,769 --> 02:10:36,671
Read it.

2068
02:10:36,771 --> 02:10:37,706
Cast a spell.

2069
02:10:37,806 --> 02:10:39,139
Read it!

2070
02:10:39,239 --> 02:10:41,308
-Elphaba.
-Don't...

2071
02:10:45,780 --> 02:10:47,948
You can't, can you?

2072
02:10:49,818 --> 02:10:51,352
Can you?

2073
02:10:57,958 --> 02:10:59,293
That's why you need all of this.

2074
02:10:59,393 --> 02:11:02,731
And you need spies
and-and animals in cages

2075
02:11:02,831 --> 02:11:04,699
and an-an enemy. You...

2076
02:11:04,799 --> 02:11:06,467
You have no real power.

2077
02:11:06,568 --> 02:11:08,737
Exactly.

2078
02:11:08,837 --> 02:11:10,304
That's why I need you.

2079
02:11:10,404 --> 02:11:14,609
Think of your future, deary.

2080
02:11:14,709 --> 02:11:15,677
Stay back.

2081
02:11:18,613 --> 02:11:20,214
Elphie, listen to them.

2082
02:11:21,616 --> 02:11:23,150
Please.

2083
02:11:23,250 --> 02:11:24,885
Good advice, young lady.

2084
02:11:24,985 --> 02:11:29,089
Listen, uh, Elphaba,
if you can pull this off,

2085
02:11:29,189 --> 02:11:31,693
first crack out of the box...

2086
02:11:31,793 --> 02:11:33,894
Oh. Oh, my golly.

2087
02:11:33,994 --> 02:11:35,630
I can't even imagine.

2088
02:11:35,730 --> 02:11:38,999
And I meant every word
about you having a home here.

2089
02:11:39,099 --> 02:11:41,301
It's gonna be you and me

2090
02:11:41,402 --> 02:11:44,773
and, hey,
if it'd make you happy,

2091
02:11:44,873 --> 02:11:47,709
possibly... your friend.

2092
02:11:47,809 --> 02:11:49,276
Really?

2093
02:11:49,376 --> 02:11:51,311
Why not?

2094
02:11:52,514 --> 02:11:54,181
No.

2095
02:11:56,183 --> 02:11:58,218
Elphaba!

2096
02:11:58,318 --> 02:11:59,920
--You want
to do yourself some good?

2097
02:12:00,020 --> 02:12:02,089
Get her back.

2098
02:12:04,958 --> 02:12:07,461
Elphie. Elphie!

2099
02:12:13,367 --> 02:12:15,870
Listen.

2100
02:12:20,174 --> 02:12:22,376
Listen!

2101
02:12:22,476 --> 02:12:25,145
If you want to keep
your families safe,

2102
02:12:25,245 --> 02:12:28,182
you'll stay loyal to our Wizard.

2103
02:12:28,282 --> 02:12:30,350
She did this.

2104
02:12:30,451 --> 02:12:31,786
The green one.

2105
02:12:31,886 --> 02:12:34,288
Don't let her get away!

2106
02:13:21,936 --> 02:13:23,237
Elphie, where are you going?

2107
02:13:23,337 --> 02:13:24,873
Elphie, what are you doing?!

2108
02:13:24,973 --> 02:13:26,674
Oh. Oh! No.

2109
02:13:26,774 --> 02:13:28,175
Elphaba, please.

2110
02:13:28,275 --> 02:13:29,878
Come back. Let's just
have a word with them.

2111
02:13:29,978 --> 02:13:32,112
Elphie. Elphie!

2112
02:13:32,212 --> 02:13:33,548
What are you doing?

2113
02:13:34,949 --> 02:13:36,016
No, no, no, no!

2114
02:13:39,353 --> 02:13:40,420
Take it!

2115
02:13:41,956 --> 02:13:43,423
Elphie!

2116
02:13:43,525 --> 02:13:45,392
Oh! Oh, my gosh!

2117
02:13:58,505 --> 02:13:59,506
Guards.

2118
02:13:59,607 --> 02:14:02,409
Guards.

2119
02:14:02,510 --> 02:14:03,511
Guards.

2120
02:14:03,611 --> 02:14:07,916
There's a fugitive at large
here in the palace.

2121
02:14:08,016 --> 02:14:11,553
Bring her to me.

2122
02:14:18,560 --> 02:14:20,193
-Elphaba, what are you doing?
-Just follow me.

2123
02:14:20,294 --> 02:14:21,763
-Follow me.
-Where? What?

2124
02:14:21,863 --> 02:14:23,297
Are you out of your mind?

2125
02:14:23,397 --> 02:14:24,899
Goodness, Elphaba,
you're being ridiculous.

2126
02:14:24,999 --> 02:14:26,199
Just come on.

2127
02:14:26,300 --> 02:14:28,536
Where are you going?

2128
02:14:28,636 --> 02:14:30,004
Up.

2129
02:14:36,376 --> 02:14:38,813
-Get in quickly.
-Absolutely ridi...

Quick. Jump.

2131

02:15:03,403 --> 02:15:05,907
Give me my leg.

2139
02:15:06,007 --> 02:15:07,675
Give me my leg.

2140
02:15:34,301 --> 02:15:35,670

No!
